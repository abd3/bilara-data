  "snp3.10:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "snp3.10:1.3": "Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",

  "snp3.10:2.1": "When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika, ",
  "snp3.10:2.2": "“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! ",
  "snp3.10:2.3": "Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, ",
  "snp3.10:2.4": "they’re good monks.” ",
  "snp3.10:3.1": "For a second time … ",
  "snp3.10:3.2": "For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, ",
  "snp3.10:3.3": "“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” ",

  "snp3.10:4.1": "Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. ",
  "snp3.10:4.2": "Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. ",
  "snp3.10:4.3": "The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. ",
  "snp3.10:4.12": "Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. ",
  "snp3.10:4.13": "He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. ",
  "snp3.10:5.1": "Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, ",
  "snp3.10:5.3": "“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away. ",
  "snp3.10:5.4": "He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” ",
  "snp3.10:5.5": "That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. ",
  "snp3.10:5.6": "Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. ",

  "snp3.10:7.1": "When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, ",
  "snp3.10:7.2": "“Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” ",
  "snp3.10:7.3": "“It’s long, mendicant. ",
  "snp3.10:7.4": "It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” ",
  "snp3.10:7.5": "“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” ",
  "snp3.10:7.6": "“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. ",
  "snp3.10:8.1": "“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. ",
  "snp3.10:8.3": "By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. ",
  "snp3.10:8.4": "Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell. ",
  "snp3.10:8.5": "Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell. ",
