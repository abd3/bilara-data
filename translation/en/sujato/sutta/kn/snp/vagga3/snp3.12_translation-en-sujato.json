  "snp3.12:1.4": "Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them: ",
  "snp3.12:2.1": "“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘There are skillful teachings that are noble, emancipating, and lead to awakening. What is the real reason for listening to such teachings?’ You should answer:",

  "snp3.12:4.1": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
