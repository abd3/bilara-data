  "snp3.9:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "snp3.9:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. ",
  "snp3.9:1.3": "Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included ",
  "snp3.9:1.4": "the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. ",
  "snp3.9:1.5": "Then as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question:",
  "snp3.9:1.6": "“How do you become a brahmin?”",
  "snp3.9:2.1": "Bhāradvāja said this: ",
  "snp3.9:2.2": "“When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation—then you’re a brahmin.” ",
  "snp3.9:3.1": "Vāseṭṭha said this: ",
  "snp3.9:3.2": "“When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—then you’re a brahmin.” ",
  "snp3.9:3.3": "But neither was able to persuade the other. ",
  "snp3.9:4.1": "So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, ",
  "snp3.9:4.2": "“Master Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. ",
  "snp3.9:4.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "snp3.9:4.4": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "snp3.9:4.5": "Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. ",
  "snp3.9:4.6": "As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” ",
  "snp3.9:4.7": "“Yes, sir,” replied Bhāradvāja. ",
  "snp3.9:5.1": "So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "snp3.9:5.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, ",
  "snp3.9:5.3": "and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse: ",
  "snp3.9:6.1": "“We’re both authorized masters ",
  "snp3.9:6.2": "of the three Vedas. ",
  "snp3.9:6.3": "I’m a student of Pokkharasāti, ",

  "snp3.9:8.1": "We have a dispute ",
  "snp3.9:8.2": "regarding the question of ancestry. ",
  "snp3.9:8.3": "For Bhāradvāja says that ",
  "snp3.9:8.4": "one is a brahmin due to birth, ",
  "snp3.9:8.5": "but I declare it’s because of one’s actions. ",
  "snp3.9:8.6": "Oh seer, know this as our debate. ",
  "snp3.9:9.1": "Since neither of us was able ",
  "snp3.9:9.2": "to convince the other, ",
  "snp3.9:9.3": "we’ve come to ask you, sir, ",
  "snp3.9:9.4": "renowned as the awakened one. ",
  "snp3.9:10.1": "As people honor with joined palms ",

  "snp3.9:11.3": "is one a brahmin due to birth, ",
  "snp3.9:11.4": "or else because of actions? ",
  "snp3.9:11.5": "We don’t know, please tell us, ",
  "snp3.9:11.6": "so that we can know a brahmin.” ",
  "snp3.9:12.1": "“I shall explain to you,” ",
