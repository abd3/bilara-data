  "snp3.7:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "snp3.7:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Northern Āpaṇas together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Northern Āpaṇas named Āpaṇa. ",
  "snp3.7:1.3": "The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard: ",
  "snp3.7:1.4": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. ",
  "snp3.7:1.5": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "snp3.7:1.6": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "snp3.7:1.7": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "snp3.7:1.8": "He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "snp3.7:1.9": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.” ",
  "snp3.7:2.1": "So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "snp3.7:2.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. ",
  "snp3.7:2.3": "The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk. ",
  "snp3.7:2.4": "Then he said to the Buddha, ",
  "snp3.7:2.5": "“Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” ",
  "snp3.7:2.6": "When he said this, the Buddha said to him, ",
  "snp3.7:2.7": "“The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.” ",
  "snp3.7:3.1": "For a second time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering. ",
  "snp3.7:3.2": "“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.",
  "snp3.7:3.3": "Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” ",
  "snp3.7:3.4": "And for a second time, the Buddha gave the same reply.",
  "snp3.7:4.1": "For a third time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering. ",
  "snp3.7:4.2": "“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.",
  "snp3.7:4.3": "Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” ",
  "snp3.7:4.4": "The Buddha consented in silence. ",
  "snp3.7:4.5": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage. There he addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, ",
  "snp3.7:4.6": "“Gentlemen, please listen. ",
  "snp3.7:4.7": "The ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal. ",
  "snp3.7:4.8": "Please help me with the preparations.” ",
  "snp3.7:4.9": "“Yes, sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats. ",
  "snp3.7:4.10": "Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself. ",
  "snp3.7:5.1": "Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred students to recite the hymns. ",
  "snp3.7:6.1": "And at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela. ",
  "snp3.7:6.2": "Then Sela, while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred students, approached Keṇiya’s hermitage. ",
  "snp3.7:6.3": "He saw the preparations going on, ",
  "snp3.7:6.4": "and said to Keṇiya, ",
  "snp3.7:6.5": "“Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?” ",
  "snp3.7:7.1": "“There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming. ",
  "snp3.7:7.2": "Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice. ",
  "snp3.7:7.3": "The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. ",
  "snp3.7:7.4": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "snp3.7:7.5": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "snp3.7:7.6": "He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.” ",
  "snp3.7:7.7": "“Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?” ",
  "snp3.7:7.8": "“I said ‘the awakened one’.” ",
  "snp3.7:7.9": "“Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?” ",
  "snp3.7:7.10": "“I said ‘the awakened one’.” ",
  "snp3.7:8.1": "Then Sela thought, ",
  "snp3.7:8.2": "“It’s hard to even find the word ‘awakened one’ in the world. ",
  "snp3.7:8.3": "The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. ",
  "snp3.7:8.4": "If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. ",
  "snp3.7:8.5": "He has the following seven treasures: ",
  "snp3.7:8.6": "the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. ",
  "snp3.7:8.7": "He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. "
