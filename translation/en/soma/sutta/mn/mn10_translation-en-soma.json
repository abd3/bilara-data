  "mn10:1.5": "“Venerable Sir,” the mendicants replied to the Bhagavant. ",
  "mn10:1.6": "The Bhagavant said this: ",
  "mn10:2.1": "“This is the direct path for the purification of all beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the going away of suffering and sadness, for the arrival of knowledge, for the personal realization of Nibbāna: these four establishments of mindfulness. ",
  "mn10:3.1": "What four? ",
  "mn10:3.2": "Here one dwells observing the body in the body, ardent, clearly aware, and mindful (fully present), removing any wanting and dissatisfaction for the world; ",

  "mn10:4.1": "And how does a mendicant dwell observing the body in the body? ",
  "mn10:4.2": "Here, a mendicant goes to the forest, or to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, and sits down cross legged, with an upright body, and brings up mindfulness at the forefront. ",
  "mn10:4.3": "One inhales simply mindful, one exhales simply mindful. ",

  "mn10:4.6": "One trains oneself: ‘I am will inhale perceiving the entire body,’ one trains oneself ‘I will exhale perceiving the entire body.’ ",
  "mn10:4.7": "One trains oneself ‘I will inhale calming bodily motion,’ one trains oneself ‘I will exhale calming bodily motion.’ ",
  "mn10:4.8": "Just like an expert turner or a turner’s apprentice when making a long turn knows ‘I am making a long turn,’ and when making a short turn knows ‘I am making a short turn,’ ",
  "mn10:4.9": "in the same way, when one inhales a long breath, one knows ‘I am inhaling a long breath,’ when one exhales a long breath one knows ‘I am exhaling a long breath,’ when one inhales a short breath, one knows ‘I am inhaling a short breath,’ and when one exhales a short breath, one knows ‘I am exhaling a short breath.’ ",
