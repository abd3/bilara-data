# About Publication Sources

This folder contains source files used to generate Bilara text on SuttaCentral.

It does not contain all source files.

The purpose of keeping the files is:

- maintain a permanent and exact record of the sources used to generate SC texts
- enable checking for any errors in processing
- make available full metadata, which is often hard to parse programatically
- preserve files in case their original site disappears

Each text has a folder, named after the UID on SuttaCentral. Each folder may contain any number of files of any sort, including:

- plain text
- HTML or XML
- PDF
- scanned images

If needed, a README can be added to individual folders to clarify how the sources were used.
