  "mn1:1.2": "Two points: 1) The word for “time” can be *samay*, which is from Sanskrit or it can also be *vakhat*, which is also used in ordinary, daily language, whose root is from Urdu, *Vakht*. While not pure Indic in its origin, *vakhat* has been used for a thousand year since the arab influence. 2) The word *bhagavaa* can be translated as *bhagavant*, *bhagavan*, or by *bhagavant Buddha* (similar to B. Sujato English translation). The point is in Gujarati and Hindi, the counterpart of just *the Buddha* cannot be used, it will always have to be preceded by some honorific *bhagava*-root word. ",
  "mn1:1.4": "Investigating curly quotation marks. I think I got it. ",
  "mn1:2.2": "“Manasi karotha” or similar words will be a bit of an issue because several words and phrases that effectively mean “paying attention” or “carefully retain in mind”, in Gujarati and Hindi are simplify referred to by the word or phrases involving the word “dhyana”. I want to reserve that for the four jhanas. ",
  "mn1:3.3": "Think a bit more about this passage. ",
  "mn1:7.1": "There is no single word for *Bhūte* — the best replacement would be if used with the connotation of living or just go with a word closest to creatures. I will try to find the best fit without getting too archaic. "
