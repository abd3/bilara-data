  "sn2.10:5.4": "The deities of both Sun and Moon attended  the Mahāsamayasutta ([dn20:14.3]()) where, according to the commentary, they became _sotāpannas_ and hence the Buddha’s “sons”. Alternatively, the Buddha, by enabling the Sun’s “release” from the “confined space”, becomes the father (of light and wisdom). "
