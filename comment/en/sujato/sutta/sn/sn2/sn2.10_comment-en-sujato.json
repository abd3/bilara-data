  "sn2.10:5.4": "I don’t buy the explanation that Rāhu was a _sotāpanna_ and hence the Buddha’s spiritual son. I would be more sympathetic to the idea that this is a reference to the Buddha’s solar lineage, and would adopt such a rendering without hesitation, if it were not for the fact that _pajaṁ_ means “progeny”, not “kin”. Neither in Pali nor in Sanskrit can I find support for such a usage. I think this line, like the use of _sambādha_, is a garbled allusion to a fertility myth. Rāhu is pregnant with the sun and must give birth."
