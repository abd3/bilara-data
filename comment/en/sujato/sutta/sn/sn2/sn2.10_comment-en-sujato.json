  "sn2.10:5.4": "The commentary explains that Rāhu was a _sotāpanna_ and hence the Buddha’s spiritual son, but I find this too pat to be convincing. It could refer to  the Buddha’s solar lineage, were it not for the fact that _pajaṁ_ means “progeny”, not “kin”. Perhaps it is a garbled allusion to a fertility myth: Rāhu is pregnant with the sun and must give birth. The Buddha, by enabling the “release” from the “confined space” becomes the symbolic father (of light and hence wisdom)."
