  "sn35.245:1.2": "The idiom kittavata/ettavata literally means “to what extent/ to this extent”. It’s applied in a number of idiomatic senses, but it retains the sense of “limits”.

  "sn35.245:6.1": "_Kiṁsuka_ should be resolved _kiṁ-suka_ (“what parrot?”) rather than _kiṁ-su-ka_ (“what’s it?”), as shown by the Sanskrit spelling _kiṁśuka_. In Ritusaṁhāra 6.22, a poem sometimes attributed to Kalidasa, the comparison to a parrot is made explicit. In Pali it is also referred to as _palāsa_, in which case I use flame-of-the-forest. It is *Butea monosperma*. ",
