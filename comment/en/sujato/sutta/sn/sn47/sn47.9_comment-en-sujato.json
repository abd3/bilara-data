  "sn47.9:3.1": "BB has “shade behind the dwelling”, evidently accepting PTS’s vihārapacchāchāyāyaṁ.

  "sn47.9:3.3": "Read _diṭṭhā_ (= Sanskrit _diṣṭyā_), “fantastic, how fortunate”, per [dn26:21.9]() and [ja81:1.4](). ",
  "sn47.9:6.7": "Read _tama(t)agge_ with _tama_ as superlative, literally “at the peak of the best”. "
