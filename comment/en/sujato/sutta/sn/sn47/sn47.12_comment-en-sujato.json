  "sn47.12:1.1": "This was apparently the last time that the Buddha met Sāriputta. This encounter is recorded as part of the Mahāparinibbānasutta at [dn16:1.61.1]() and expanded into a long discourse at [dn28](). Here in the Saṁyutta, this meeting is followed with the record of Sāriputta’s passing at [sn47.13](), and then the lament for the absence of both Sāriputta and Moggallāna at [sn47.14 ](). For some reason these events were omitted from the Mahāparinibbānasutta, even though they fit well thematically. ",
  "sn47.12:6.1": "The phrase dhammanvaya occurs, as well as here, at MN 89 (by Pasenadi) and MN 12 (in reference to Sunakkhatta, albeit in negative). It thus seems to me that it can’t mean a particularly deep insight, such as is unique to Sariputta. The other striking characteristic of the term is that it always occurs in connection with the Buddha personally. In MN 89, Pasenadi sees various things such as the behavior of the monks, then makes his inference. Similarly, here it is inferred from characteristics of the teaching. Thus it seems it means an inference (about the Buddha) as implied by his teaching and the way it’s practiced. "
