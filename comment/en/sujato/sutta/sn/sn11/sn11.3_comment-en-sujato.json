  "sn11.3:14.2": "_Narāsabha_ is literally “a bull of a man”, but the predominant sense is “chief”, “lord” rather than “bull”. _Vṛṣabha_ was widely used in this sense as far back as the Rig Veda, unlike English, where “bull” conveys quite a different set of connotations. The same is true of its synonyms _janavasabha_ and _purisnisabha_, but not _purisūsabho_ at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.21.4](). "
