  "sn11.13:9.1": "Vāsava means “endowed with wealth” (_vasu_; see for example Rig Veda 1.9.9a _indraṁ vasupatiṁ_ “Indra, lord of wealth”). This passage, rather, plays on the word _āvasatha_ and calls him the “giver of a guesthouse”. Later Brahmanical texts enumerated eight Vasus, with Indra as their lord, who are reckoned among the Thirty-Three. "
