  "sn24.8:0.3": "Maha here refers to the long explanation of the view, not to its “greatness”. ",
  "sn24.8:1.3": "Best to translate kaya according to sense in such philosophical contexts. For akatavidha, the idea here is that the “10,000 things” of the world are derived from these fundamental substances. ",
  "sn24.8:1.4": "BB’s rendering “to others” allows the interpretation that they can’t cause pain to things outside the seven. But the meaning is as I state. ",
  "sn24.8:1.11": "This strange cosmology lays out the course through which souls must proceed before their final liberation. | Since _nāgāvāsa_ (“abode of dragons”) occurs in a list of kinds of ascetics, I think it is a corruption of _naggāvāsa_ (“abode of naked ascetics”) and translate accordingly. Each of these refers to the number of times one will be reborn in each of these states. | _Nigaṇṭhigabbha_ could mean “rebirth as a Jain ascetic” but here we have moved on from listing ascetics, and I think it refers to one who is born free of attachments. Compare the Buddhist idea of “four kinds of conception” ([dn33:1.11.175]()). | _Pavuṭā_ is explained by the commentary as _gaṇṭhikā_ (“knot”). However, Rig Veda 9.54.2 mentions “seven rivers” (_sapta pravata_) that flow from heaven, preceded by the mention of _sarā_ (“lakes”). This detail suggests a Vedic influence. ",
  "sn24.8:1.15": "The SN reading seems to me corrupt, and I adopt the reading as found in DN and MN. "
