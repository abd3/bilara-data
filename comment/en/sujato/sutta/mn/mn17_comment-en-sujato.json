  "mn17:3.2": "This gives a brief summary of the path of meditation. First one “establishes mindfulness”, i.e. undertakes meditation based on the four _satipaṭṭhānas_. This leads to _samādhi_ as the mind becomes immersed in the four _jhānas_. Then, seeing reality with the unclouded clarity of a purified mind, defilements are abandoned and one is freed from transmigration. "
