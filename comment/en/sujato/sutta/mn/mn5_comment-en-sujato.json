  "mn5:1.2": "The Buddha does not appear in this sutta, yet he is mentioned by way of respect. Suttas that do not mention where the Buddha is staying (unless it is a mere abbreviation) typically stem from after the Buddha’s death. ",
  "mn5:4.1": "Sāriputta and Moggallāna refer to each other as _āvuso_ (“reverend”). See [dn16:6.2.1](). ",
  "mn5:6.1": "“Feature of beauty” is _subhanimitta_. In early Pali, _nimitta_ is used for a feature or quality of the mind that, when focused on, promotes the growth of similar or related qualities. Thus focusing on beauty fosters the desire for that beauty. ",
  "mn5:9.1": "This question is an interjection by Moggallāna. ",
  "mn5:10.1": "",
  "mn5:10.2": "The Vinaya depends on mutual acknowledgement of offences and mutual rehabilitation. It is a system of social morality, not just of individual responsibility. ",
  "mn5:11.2": "Many Vinaya offences can be cleared by a simple confession to a single fellow monastic. In some cases, however, especially those that are more serious, the entire Saṅgha must be involved in the rehabilitation process. In such cases, a sense of collective shame is essential to motivate the offender to change their ways. ",
  "mn5:31.7": "BB’s “son of a former cartwright” is implausible. Surely the point is that he used to be a cartwright. The idiom -putta is often disserved by rendering it as “son”; here it just means that he is “one of the cartwrights”, or “from a family of cartwrights”. ",
  "mn5:31.9": "suddhā assa sāre patiṭṭhitā recurs at AN 4.190 (of an assembly) and AN 3.93 (of seeds and monks). In both cases BB has “pure, established in the core”, whereas here he has “come to consist purely of heartwood”. ",
  "mn5:32.3": "BB follows PTS edition here, but MS is preferable. PTS omits the close -ti, and hence treats this sentence as a simple continuation of Moggallana’s speech. But it reads much better as an exclamation by the good monks. "
