  "mn5:1.2": "The Buddha does not appear in this sutta, yet he is mentioned by way of respect. Suttas that do not mention where the Buddha is staying (unless it is a mere abbreviation) typically stem from after the Buddha’s death. ",
  "mn5:4.1": "When Sāriputta and Moggallāna address each other, they use their name together with “reverend” (_āvuso_). Here we just have _āvuso_. I take it that Moggallāna is asking questions on behalf of the group, and Sāriputta addresses the group. ",
  "mn5:6.1": "“Feature of beauty” is _subhanimitta_. In early Pali, _nimitta_ is used for a feature or quality of the mind that, when focused on, promotes the growth of similar or related qualities. Thus focusing on beauty fosters the desire for that beauty. ",
  "mn5:9.1": "Following the commentary, I take this question as an interjection by Moggallāna, even though the expected personal name is lacking. ",
  "mn5:10.1": "",
  "mn5:10.2": "The Vinaya depends on mutual acknowledgement of offences and mutual rehabilitation. It is a system of social morality, not just of individual responsibility. ",
  "mn5:11.2": "Many Vinaya offences can be cleared by a simple confession to a single fellow monastic. In more serious cases, however, the entire resident Saṅgha must be involved in the rehabilitation process. In such cases, a sense of collective shame is essential to motivate the offender to change their ways. ",
  "mn5:12.2": "Seniority has only a very limited role in the Vinaya. Generally speaking, all monastics have the same rights and privileges regardless of their standing, so any monastic can bring a charge against any other. ",
  "mn5:14.2": "Normally, mendicants would wander for alms, which was usually done alone or with an attendant. In some places today, such as north-east Thailand, we see mendicants going for alms in a line. The phrasing of this passage, however, seems to refer to an occasion when a group of mendicants have been invited to take the meal in someone’s house. ",
  "mn5:16.2": "This is the _anumodana_, which is still recited in Pali today. In the Buddha’s time, however, the _anumodana_ was not an incomprehensible chant in an ancient language believed to confer a special “blessing”. Rather, it was a short teaching on the benefits of giving, emphasizing the positive effects of the donor’s actions. See examples at [dn16:1.31.2]() = [ud8.6:22.1](), [mn92:26.1]() = [snp3.7:35.1](), [sn55.26:20.1](), [an5.44:8.1](), [an54:8.1](), [Kd 8:15.14.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#15.14.4), and [Kd 16:1.5.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#1.5.1). ",
  "mn5:17.2": "It is an offence for a monk to teach nuns with a worldly motive ([Bu Pc 24](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc24/en/brahmali)). ",
  "mn5:29.1": "These are the outward signs of someone living a dedicated ascetic life. These and other practices are called _dhutaṅga_ (“shaking off”) and may be voluntarily undertaken in order to live more freely without attachments. ",
  "mn5:31.7": "BB’s “son of a former cartwright” is implausible. Surely the point is that he used to be a cartwright. The idiom -putta is often disserved by rendering it as “son”; here it just means that he is “one of the cartwrights”, or “from a family of cartwrights”. ",
  "mn5:31.9": "suddhā assa sāre patiṭṭhitā recurs at AN 4.190 (of an assembly) and AN 3.93 (of seeds and monks). In both cases BB has “pure, established in the core”, whereas here he has “come to consist purely of heartwood”. ",
  "mn5:32.3": "BB follows PTS edition here, but MS is preferable. PTS omits the close -ti, and hence treats this sentence as a simple continuation of Moggallana’s speech. But it reads much better as an exclamation by the good monks. "
