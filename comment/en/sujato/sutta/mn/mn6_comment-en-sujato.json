  "mn6:2.1": "The “monastic code” (_pātimokkha_) is the primary list of rules for Buddhist monastics. There are many extant _pātimokkhas_ stemming from early Buddhist schools in Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit, all mostly similar but with some variation especially in minor rules of etiquette. Each fortnight it is recited on the sabbath (_uposatha_) to affirm the communal values of the Saṅgha. Usually some other passages are recited, including this exhortation to keep the rules (also at [an4.12:1.1](), [an10.71:2.1](), and [iti111:2.1]()), as well as the verses known as _ovāda pātimokkha_ ([dn14:3.28.1]()). | Commentaries offer several explanations for the word _pātimokkha_, favoring the sense “release” (from remorse and suffering). The Buddha says he laid it down to hold the community together like flowers bunched with string ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.6]()), which suggests rather a connection with _paṭimukka_, “binding” ([mn38:41.11]()).
