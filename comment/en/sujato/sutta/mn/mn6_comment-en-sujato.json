  "mn6:2.1": "The “monastic code” (_pātimokkha_) is the primary list of rules for Buddhist monastics. Each fortnight it is recited on the sabbath (_uposatha_) to affirm the communal values of the Saṅgha. The communities of monks and nuns each gather in their respective designated places and select a monastic to recite, which is considered a great honor. Any transgressions are confessed beforehand. The rules are recited by heart, typically taking close to an hour. Usually some other passages are recited, including this exhortation to keep the rules (also at [an4.12:1.1](), [an10.71:2.1](), and [iti111:2.1]()). There are many extant _pātimokkhas_ stemming from early Buddhist schools in Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit, all mostly similar but with some variation especially in minor rules of etiquette. | The word _pātimokkha_ is of uncertain derivation. But it seems that originally it referred to the verses known as _ovāda pātimokkha_, which are still included in the recitation in most Vinayas ([dn14:3.28.1]()). "
