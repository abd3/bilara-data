  "mn6:2.1": "The “monastic code” (_pātimokkha_) is the primary list of rules for Buddhist monastics. Each fortnight it is recited on the sabbath (_uposatha_) to affirm the communal values of the Saṅgha. The communities of monks and nuns each gather in a designated place, and one monastic is selected to recite, which is considered a great honor. The rules are recited by heart, typically taking close to an hour. Usually some other passages are recited, including this exhortation to keep the rules. | The word _pātimokkha_ is of uncertain derivation. But it seems that originally it referred to the verses known as _ovāda pātimokkha_, which are still included in the recitation in most Vinayas ([dn14:3.28.1]()). "
