  "mn15:3.32": "_Apadāna_ means the traces or marks left behind, in this case the evidence of misdeeds. ",
  "mn15:6.1": "_Anumāna_ seems to only occur twice in the early texts, here and in the passive form _anumīyati_ at [sn22.36:1.4](), where the sense must be to “measure against”. The normal sense in later literature (eg. [mil6.4.1]()) is “inference”, which is normally _anvaya_ in the suttas. It seems to me this meaning applies here, as the passage specifically discusses, not an inference in general, but how one is to measure oneself against another. This section is about an external standard, the next section on reflection is about an inner standard. The commentary glosses “should measure against, should scrutinize, should survey”. "
