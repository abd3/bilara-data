  "mn15:3.32": "_Apadāna_ means the traces or marks left behind, in this case the evidence of misdeeds. ",
  "mn15:6.1": "_Anumāna_ seems to only occur twice in the early texts, here and in the passive form _anumīyati_ at [sn22.36:1.4](), where the sense must be to “measure against”. The normal sense in later literature (eg. [mil6.4.1]()) is “inference”, which in the suttas is normally _anvaya_. This passage discusses how one is to compare oneself against another, an external standard, whereas the next section on reflection applies an inner standard. The commentary gloss is: “should measure against, should scrutinize, should examine”. "
