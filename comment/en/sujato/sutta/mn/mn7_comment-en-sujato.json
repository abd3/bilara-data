  "mn7:2.5": "A “bad destiny” (_duggati_) is any realm below the human, namely the animal, ghost, and hell realms. ",
  "mn7:3.1": "Here the text shifts from _saṅkiliṭṭha_ (“corrupt”) to _upakkilesa_ (“corruption”). These are general terms for unskillful qualities of mind and the change in prefix has no particular significence. ",
  "mn7:5.32": "“Experiential” is _avecca_, literally “having undergone”. “Experiential confidence” is the faith of a stream-enterer, who has seen for themselves. ",
  "mn7:5.33": "They have experiential confidence in the Buddha as a teacher because they have followed his path and realized the results that he speaks of. ",
  "mn7:19.6": "BB has “liberation”, obviously following PTS in reading “mokkhasammata”. This reading is supported by MA 93, which has 度相. (The other Chinese parallel at T 51 doesn’t have a close parallel with this phrase.) However the comm evidently reads lokkha: Tattha lokkhasammatāti lūkhabhāvasammatā, lūkhabhāvanti cokkhabhāvaṁ, visuddhibhāvaṁ detīti evaṁ sammatāti vuttaṁ hoti. The problem is that lokkha gives the exact opposite sense: rough or dirty. Nor does there appear to be any supporting sense in Sanskrit. The PTS dict suggests reading cokkha=clean here: https://suttacentral.net/define/cokkha, and I think this is the best reading. Liberation doesn’t fit the imagery of the text. Nor, so far as I know, was it generally held among the brahmins that liberation came from bathing alone. On the contrary, it is precisely those brahmins who developed the notion of liberation who insisted on the inner understanding. I suspect the Chinese translation, therefore, is a normalization, as is the reading mokkha in the Pali. "
