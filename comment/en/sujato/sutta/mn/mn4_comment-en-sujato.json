  "mn4:2.1": "This is the first time we have encountered a brahmin, or indeed any non-Buddhists, in the Majjhima. Relative to the Dīgha, the Majjhima looks more inward to the Buddhist community, although of course with no lack of exceptions. We meet Jānussoṇi many times in the suttas, where he converses with the Buddha on a number of topics, apparently having a special interest in the afterlife. His name appears to be equivalent to the Sanskrit Jānaśruti or Jānaśruteya, which are patronymics of Janaśruti, “famed among the people”, with the element _soṇi_ coming from the Vedic _ṣvaṇi_ (“sound”). The Chinese rendering <span lang='lzh'>生聞</span> (“Born Famous”, T 125.2.665b18) evidently assumes the same derivation, as _jana_ “people” is from _√jan_ ‘born”. According to the commentary it is a title awarded the family priest (_purohita_) of Kosala, which would make him one of the most powerful brahmins alive. This account, however, is doubtful, as I can find no record of such a title, whereas the use of Jānaśruti as a patronymic by the descendants of Janaśruti is well attested. ",
  "mn4:2.3": "Bodhi, Nyanamoli, and Ṭhānissaro translate this as a question. However, there are none of the usual question markers and given the varied sequence as evident in the EA version (see Analayo) it seems likely that Horner was right to translate as a statement. ",
  "mn4:2.4": "This picks up from the previous sutta the themes of following the Buddha’s example \n and of seclusion. ",
