  "mn4:2.1": "This is the first time we have encountered a brahmin, or indeed any non-Buddhists, in the Majjhima. In contrast with the Dīgha, the Majjhima looks more inward to the Buddhist community, although of course with no lack of exceptions. We meet Jāṇussoṇi several times in the suttas. His name is obscure, and according to the commentary it is a title awarded the family priest (_purohita_) of Kosala, making him one of the most powerful brahmins alive. The Chinese rendering <span lang='lzh'>生聞</span> (T 125.2.665b18) translates as “Born Famous”, evidently taking _jānu_ from √_jan_ and _soṇi_ from the Vedic _ṣvaṇi_ (“sound”). _Jāṇu_ normally means “knee”, which Kaccāyana 671 likewise derives from √_jan_ (_gamanaṁ janetītī jāṇu_, “it causes movement, thus it is the knee”).

  "mn4:2.3": "Bodhi, Nyanamoli, and Ṭhānissaro translate this as a question. However, there are none of the usual question markers and given the varied sequence as evident in the EA version (see Analayo) it seems likely that Horner was right to translate as a statement. ",
  "mn4:2.4": "This picks up from the previous sutta the themes of following the Buddha’s example \n and of seclusion. ",
