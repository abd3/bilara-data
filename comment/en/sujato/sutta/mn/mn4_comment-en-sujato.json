  "mn4:2.1": "We meet Jānussoṇi many times in the suttas, where he converses with the Buddha on a number of topics, apparently having a special interest in the afterlife. His name appears in Sanskrit as Jānaśruti or Jānaśruteya, which are patronymics of Janaśruti, “famed among the people”, with the element _soṇi_ coming from the Vedic _ṣvaṇi_ (“sound”). The Chinese rendering <span lang='lzh'>生聞</span> (“Born Famous”, T 125.2.665b18) evidently assumes the same derivation, as _jana_ (“people”) is from √_jan_ “born”. According to the commentary it is a title awarded the family priest (_purohita_) of Kosala, which would make him one of the most powerful brahmins alive. This account, however, is doubtful, as I can find no record of such a title, whereas the use of Jānaśruti as a patronymic by the descendants of Janaśruti is well attested. ",
  "mn4:2.3": "This statement is sometimes translated as a question, but it lacks the usual question markers. The parallel at [EA 31.1](https://suttacentral.net/ea31.1/lzh/taisho) reverses the sequence: Jānussoṇi first says that living in the forest is hard, then introduces the idea that the Buddha is their guide, following which the Buddha tells his life story. This makes for a better flow of ideas. ",
  "mn4:2.4": "Picking up from the previous sutta the themes of following the Buddha’s example and of seclusion. | In _diṭṭhānugatiṁ_, read _diṭṭha_ (“what has been seen, i.e. example”, rather than _diṭṭhi_ (“view”). ",
  "mn4:2.8": "",
  "mn4:3.1": "This is the first of several times in the Majjhimanikāya that the Buddha spoke of his meditation before enlightenment (see eg. [mn19](), [mn128]()). Rather than the mystical being of later tradition who was already elevated to a higher plane at birth, in these texts the Buddha takes pains to depict himself as an ordinary person who struggled with the same issues in meditation as anyone else. ",
  "mn4:4.2": "That is, their subconscious guilt will manifest as fear. Throughout this sutta, the Buddha emphasizes that fear is overcome by the proper development of the path, which leads to confidence and strength of mind. This is in implicit contrast to the notion that one overcomes fear by either brute endurance and force of will or by magical spells and charms. ",
  "mn4:5-7.7": "The purification of livelihood for an ascetic is spelled out in detail in [dn2:56.1]() as part of the Gradual Training of a Buddhist mendicant. The current sutta can, in fact, be read as a variant presentation of the Gradual Training. ",
  "mn4:20.3": "These are the days of _uposatha_ (“sabbath”) marking the lunar cycle. ",
  "mn4:21.1": "The Buddha illustrates his claim that the forests can rob the mind of a meditator without _samādhi_. During the development of meditation, perception can change in strange and unsettling ways, making the meditator question the nature of reality. In some cases, over-exertion in meditation can indeed lead to mental breakdown. ",
  "mn4:21.3": "This alludes to the oft-repeated phrase “as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day”, which is associated with the meditative perception of light ([an4.41:3.3]()), the development of the bases of psychic power ([sn51.11:1.10]()), and the dispelling of drowsiness [an7.61:7.2](). The point of that phrase is that the mind has been developed until it is full of light regardless of whether it is light or dark outside. Here, the Buddha forestalls the accusation that this is deluded: he knows perfectly well what is day and what is night. ",
  "mn4:34.4": "",
  "mn4:34.5": "Also at [an2.30:1.1](). The Buddha confirms Jānussoṇi’s belief that he acts to set a good example for others. ",
  "mn4:35.4": "Jānussoṇi goes forth so often in the suttas it is almost a genre unto itself ([mn27](), [sn12:47](), [an2.17:3.1](), [an3:55](), [an3:59](), [an4:184](), [an6:52](), [an7:47](), [an10:119](), [an10:167](), [an10:177]()). Such narrative accounts of conversion or enlightenment at the end of discourses are not very reliable, as they are not the Buddha’s words but were added by editors at some point. "
