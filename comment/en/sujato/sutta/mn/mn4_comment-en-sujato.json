  "mn4:2.1": "We meet Jānussoṇi many times in the suttas, where he converses with the Buddha on a number of topics, apparently having a special interest in the afterlife. His name appears in Sanskrit as Jānaśruti or Jānaśruteya, which are patronymics of Janaśruti, “famed among the people”, with the element _soṇi_ coming from the Vedic _ṣvaṇi_ (“sound”). The Chinese rendering <span lang='lzh'>生聞</span> (“Born Famous”, T 125.2.665b18) evidently assumes the same derivation, as _jana_ (“people”) is from √_jan_ “born”. According to the commentary it is a title awarded the family priest (_purohita_) of Kosala, which would make him one of the most powerful brahmins alive. This account, however, is doubtful, as I can find no record of such a title, whereas the use of Jānaśruti as a patronymic by the descendants of Janaśruti is well attested. ",

This makes for a better flow of ideas. ",
