  "mn12:1.2": "This description of the Buddha’s location is unique. ",
  "mn12:2.1": "Sunakkhatta’s dismal spiritual career began when he met the Buddha in [mn105](). In [dn6:5.3]() we learn that, after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in meditation. The current sutta and [dn24]() deal with Sunakkhatta’s bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal. ",
  "mn12:2.3": "These distinctions are defined in the Vinaya [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:3.8]() as “absorption, release, immersion, attainment, knowledge and vision, development of the path, realization of the fruits, giving up the defilements, a mind without hindrances, delighting in an empty dwelling”. They are usually summarized as absorption, psychic abilities, and realization of the paths and fruits. ",
  "mn12:29.6": "BB has “many hundreds of assemblies” but at AN 8.69 he changes it to “an assembly consisting of many hundreds” ",
  "mn12:38.3": "BB has ’etremely', but text (here and PTS) omits ekanta. ",
  "mn12:39.8": "Judging from this metaphor, did the Buddha visit Australia? ",
  "mn12:47.3": "I’m not sure that BB’s “in the crevices” here makes sense. If they’re inn a crevice, would you just step over them? At AN 10.21 the identical phrase in a different context is rendered, “let me not harm small creatures that cross my path”. It’s interesting that the thoughts of the ascetic and the lion are the same. ",
  "mn12:49.3": "Mahavikata is a Vinaya term for these things when eaten, i.e. the phrase doesn’t mean “distortion in eating “but” eating of distorted things”. ",
  "mn12:52.6": "BB’s “make” is incorrect, there is no insinuation that they made these themselves. ",
  "mn12:52.7": "I’m not convinced by BB’s “per day” here, there is no āha. "
