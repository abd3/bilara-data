  "mn9:1.3": "The Chinese and Sanskrit parallels depict this discourse as a conversation between Sāriputta and Mahākoṭṭhita, a context that appears to have been lost in the Pali. ",
  "mn9:2.2": "In other words, a stream-enterer. ",
  "mn9:3.1": "That is, the deed and the motivating force behind the deed. ",
  "mn9:3.2": "Sāriputta had a deliberate, systematic, and unhurried approach to teaching. First he introduces a fundamental question, in this case stream-entry. Then he gives a simple and practical answer. Then he goes on to draw out implications both broad and deep. ",
  "mn9:4.2": "Note that covetousness, ill will, and wrong view are strong forms of greed, hate, and delusion respectively. ",
  "mn9:6.2": "These are the “ten ways of doing skillful deeds” (_dasakusalakammapathā_) found frequently throughout the suttas. The first three pertain to body; the middle four to speech; and the last three to mind. ",
  "mn9:8.1": "This passage indicates the arahant. The phrasing is problematic, as it suggests that one has right view (stream-entry) only after fully relinquishing all defilements (arahantship). The commentary records a discussion of this problem, but in fact it is probably due to a textual corruption in the Pali text, as the parallels at MA 29 and SA 344 lack this passage. This shows how difficulties in the Pali text can sometimes lead to fruitless discussions in the absence of the broader context offered by parallels. ",
  "mn9:9.2": "By giving a brief and simple answer to a profound question, Sāriputta leaves room for the audience to request further explanation. This teaching method ensures audience engagement and conveys information in digestible doses. ",
  "mn9:10.2": "Sāriputta introduces the framework of the four noble truths, but structured in terms of “fuel” rather than suffering. “Fuel” (or “food” or “nutriment”, _āhāra_) is literally “intake” and it refers to both the thing that acts as a condition, fuel, or support, as well as the internal grasping and attachment to that thing. In this way, as well as in the form of the word, it is very similar to “grasping” (_upādāna_, literally “uptake”), which can also mean “fuel”. ",
  "mn9:11.2": "Also at [mn38:15.1](), [sn12.11](), [sn12.12](), [sn12.63](), [sn12.64](). | Those who are “about to be born” is _sambhavesī_, which I follow Norman and Bodhi in reading as a future active participle, although the commentary takes it in the sense “seeking” to be born. The phrase indicates those between one life and another. ",
  "mn9:21-22.7": "Text lacks a corresponding “what is old age” on the previous section. ",
  "mn9:21-22.12": "Here, translating jati as “birth” obviously doesn’t work. You don’t stop getting old when your birth is over. What it means is the process of rebirth in samsara. "
