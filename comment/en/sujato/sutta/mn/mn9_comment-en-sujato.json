  "mn9:1.3": "The Chinese and Sanskrit parallels depict this discourse as a conversation between Sāriputta and Mahākoṭṭhita, a context that appears to have been lost in the Pali. ",
  "mn9:2.2": "In other words, a stream-enterer. In [mn141:5.6](), Sāriputta is said to teach students as far as as stream-entry, while his friend Moggallāna leads them to arahantship. ",
  "mn9:3.1": "That is, the deed and the motivating force behind the deed. ",
  "mn9:3.2": "Sāriputta had a deliberate, systematic, and unhurried approach to teaching. First he introduces a fundamental question, in this case stream-entry. Then he gives a simple and practical answer. Then he goes on to draw out implications both broad and deep. ",
  "mn9:4.2": "Note that covetousness, ill will, and wrong view are strong forms of greed, hate, and delusion respectively. ",
  "mn9:6.2": "These are the “ten ways of doing skillful deeds” (_dasakusalakammapathā_) found frequently throughout the suttas. The first three pertain to body; the middle four to speech; and the last three to mind. ",
  "mn9:8.1": "This passage, which is repeated throughout the sutta, indicates the arahant. The phrasing is problematic, as it suggests that one has right view (stream-entry) only after fully relinquishing all defilements (arahantship). The commentary records a discussion of this problem, but in fact it is probably due to a textual corruption in the Pali text, as the parallels at MA 29 and SA 344 lack this passage. This shows how difficulties in the Pali text can sometimes lead to fruitless discussions in the absence of the broader context offered by parallels. ",
  "mn9:9.2": "By giving a brief and simple answer to a profound question, Sāriputta leaves room for the audience to request further explanation. This teaching method ensures audience engagement and conveys information in digestible doses. ",
  "mn9:10.2": "Sāriputta introduces the framework of the four noble truths, but structured in terms of “fuel” rather than suffering. | “Fuel” (or “food” or “nutriment”, _āhāra_) refers to both the thing that acts as a condition, fuel, or support, as well as the internal grasping and attachment to that thing. Its use as a philosophical term appears to be an innovation by the Buddha, replacing the _anna_ so dear to Vedic seers. However, see the notable precursor to dependent origination at Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2: “from purity of _āhāra_ there is purity of being; from purity of being there is stable memory (mindfulness); relying on memory there is release from all ties” (_āhāraśuddhau sattvaśuddhiḥ | sattvaśuddhau dhruvā smṛtiḥ | smṛtilambhe sarvagranthīnāṃ vipramokṣaḥ_). ",
  "mn9:11.2": "Also at [mn38:15.1](), [sn12.11](), [sn12.12](), [sn12.63](), [sn12.64](). | Those who are “about to be born” is _sambhavesī_, which I follow Norman and Bodhi in reading as a future active participle, although the commentary takes it in the sense “seeking” to be born. The phrase is one of several in the suttas that appears to indicate an intermediate state between one life and the next, despite the fact that this view is formally rejected by the Theravada school ([Kv 8.2](https://suttacentral.net/kv8.2)). ",
  "mn9:11.4": "Coarse solid food sustains the bodies of beings in the human and animal realms, while fine solid food sustains the gods and ancestors, a belief intertwined with the Vedic notion that the gods partake of the food offered in sacrifice (eg. Rig Veda 1.187). | “Contact” (_phassa_) is the interaction between the inner and outer worlds, allowing us to situate ourselves in a sensory world full of fears and joys, stimulating feeling and hence the craving for more. | “Volition” (_manosañcetanā_) allows us to act in the world revealed by the senses and secure further “fuel”. | “Consciousness” (_viññāṇa_) is aware of all this, experiencing suffering, and giving rise to a new “name and form” in a future life in a fruitless search to find a world free of pain. Thus the four “fuels” can be considered as a distinctive perspective on dependent origination. ",
  "mn9:11.5": "This places “fuel” (_āhāra_) at the same point in dependent origination that is normally occupied by “grasping” (_upādāna_). Both words share the basic meaning “intake”, and both can have the sense of “fuel”. ",
  "mn9:14-18.2": "Here Sāriputta gives the classic statement on the four noble truths in terms of suffering (_dukkha_). ",
  "mn9:14-18.5": "The definitions are direct quotes from the Buddha’s first sermon, the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta ([sn56.11:4.2]()). They are notably emphasized by Sāriputta, who delves even further into them ([mn28:3.2](), [mn141:10.2]()). ",
  "mn9:14-18.8": "This definition clarifies two common misunderstandings. First, not all desire causes suffering, for some kinds of desire lead out of suffering ([sn51.15:4.1]()). Second, rebirth is not a tangential part of the Buddha’s teachings, uncritically inherited from cultural suppositions; it is baked into the fundamental meaning of the four noble truths. | The idiom _tatratatra_ (literally “there, there”) is not selective (“here and there”) but distributive (“everywhere”). For a Vedic precursor, see the note to the same idiom at [mn2:8.8](). By taking pleasure in sense experience, the mind binds itself to the need for continued stimulation in future lives. The distancing sense “there” is important, for craving does not merely satisfy itself with what it currently experiences, but must always seek out renewed gratification. ",
  "mn9:21-22.7": "Text lacks a corresponding “what is old age” on the previous section. ",
  "mn9:21-22.12": "Here, translating jati as “birth” obviously doesn’t work. You don’t stop getting old when your birth is over. What it means is the process of rebirth in samsara. ",
  "mn9:60-62.5": "This is the final item in the Chinese and Sanskrit parallels. ",
  "mn9:64-66.4": "“Ignorance” is the only item not found in the Chinese and Sanskrit parallels. ",
  "mn9:69.2": "The appearance of “defilement” (_āsava_) at the end is appropriate, as its appearance in the four noble truths formula usually signifies arahantship. Nonetheless, the Chinese and Sanskrit parallels place it much earlier, after the four fuels. The sequence of the remaining items is mostly consistent between parallels. "
