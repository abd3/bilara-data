  "mn9:1.3": "The Chinese and Sanskrit parallels depict this discourse as a conversation between Sāriputta and Mahākoṭṭhita, a context that appears to have been lost in the Pali. ",
  "mn9:2.2": "In other words, a stream-enterer. ",
  "mn9:3.1": "That is, the deed and the motivating force behind the deed. ",
  "mn9:3.2": "Sāriputta had a deliberate, systematic, and unhurried approach to teaching. First he introduces a fundamental question, in this case stream-entry. Then he gives a simple and practical answer. Then he goes on to draw out implications both broad and deep. ",

  "mn9:8.1": "This passage indicates the arahant. The phrasing is problematic, as it suggests that one has right view (stream-entry) only after fully relinquishing all defilements (arahantship). This problem is probably due to a textual corruption in the Pali text, as the parallels at MA 29 and SA 344 lack this passage. ",
  "mn9:9.2": "By giving a brief and simple answer to a profound question, Sāriputta leaves room for the audience to request further explanation. This teaching method ensures audience engagement and conveys information in digestible doses. ",

  "mn9:21-22.12": "Here, translating jati as “birth” obviously doesn’t work. You don’t stop getting old when your birth is over. What it means is the process of rebirth in samsara. "
