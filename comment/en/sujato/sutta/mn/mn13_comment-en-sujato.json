  "mn13:3.1": "This group of three—_kāma_, _rūpa_, and _vedanā_—is also found at [an3.126]() and [an10.29](), where it also relates to the teachings of outsiders. ",
  "mn13:3.2": "The fact that _rūpa_ is in plural suggests it means “sights” here rather than ”material forms”. ",
  "mn13:3.4": "In questioning this, the wanderers display better discernment than many today, who leap all too readily from the discovery of something in common between religions to the assertion that they are therefore the same. ",
  "mn13:11.1": "Note that sisters don’t fight with sisters. They are much too sensible. ",
  "mn13:12.1": "Surely this is the correct interpretation of ubhato byulham sangamam, as found in PTS dict, an unlike BB’s “double array”. In AN, without ubhato the same phrase is rendered by him as “fray”. ",
  "mn13:13.1": "BB has “slippery” for addāvalepana. the basic meaning is “wet plaster”. While the application may indeed mean slippery, i.e. coated with something so they couldn’t be climbed, the term seems to occur in only one other passage, SN 35.243. There it is also used to signify impregnability. But rather than slipperiness, it is because the wet plaster is resistant to fire. This could equally apply in our current sutta. ",
  "mn13:13.2": "Readings here are highly uncertain. BB evidently follows PTS reading pakkaṭṭhī, but see the doubts expressed by PTS dict for that word. VRI comm has Chakaṇakāyāti kuthitagomayena. Given that the parallel passage at Cnd 199 has chakaṇaṭī, it seems pakkaṭṭhī is likely a back-reading from the comm. MA 99 and T 53 have “molten copper” 融銅, while EA 21.9 has 消鐵相灑 (translated by pasadika as “molten iron” (?)). But I am not sure what these are rendering. Excrement of various sorts was commonly used to defend castles. It may well have been hot, but if we accept chakaṇakā, the text does not say hot. Abhivagga is equally obscure. Pali has it only here, and Skt only knows it in the sense of circuit, compass. Comm says “satadanta”, which is no less obscure. Does it refer to some multi-pronged weapon? Mahabharata has a śataghnī, “a stone or cylindrical piece of wood studded with iron spikes”. My sense is that if it meant something generic like BB’s “heavy weight” we would not find it used only here. "
