  "mn13:3.1": "This group of three—_kāma_, _rūpa_, and _vedanā_—is also found at [an3.126]() and [an10.29](), where it also relates to the teachings of outsiders. ",
  "mn13:3.2": "The fact that _rūpa_ is in plural suggests it means “sights” here rather than ”material forms”. ",
  "mn13:3.4": "In questioning this, the wanderers display better discernment than many today, who leap all too readily from the discovery of something in common between religions to the assertion that they are therefore the same. ",
  "mn13:4.3": "This is the quintessential Buddhist attitude when encountering something unknown: to neither accept nor reject, but inquire. ",
  "mn13:11.1": "Sisters don’t fight with sisters. ",
  "mn13:12.1": "",
  "mn13:13.1": "Bastions were “wetly plastered” (_addāvalepana_) for resistance from fire ([sn35.243:7.1]()). ",
  "mn13:13.2": "For “splashed with dung” (_chakaṇakāyapi osiñcanti_), PTS reads _pakkaṭṭhī_, but this word appears to be spurious. The commentary says _chakaṇakā_ means “boiling cowdung”, but nothing in the word itself suggests “boiling”. The Chinese parallels at MA 99 and T 53 have “molten copper” <span lang='lzh'>融銅</span>, while EA 21.9 has “molten iron” (<span lang='lzh'>消鐵</span>). | _Abhivagga_ is only found here in Pali. The Atharvaveda (3.5.2, 6.54.2, 11.2.4) has _abhīvarga_ apparently in the sense of “domain”. The commentary says _abhivagga_ was a “hundred-toothed” weapon that crushed invaders of a castle. However, _vagga_ has the recognized military sense of “cadre, company, platoon”, so I take _abhivagga_ to mean “superior force”. ",
  "mn13:14.3": "The commentary explains these punishments thus. ‘Porridge pot’: remove the top of the skull and drop in a hot iron ball so that the brains boil over. ‘Shell-shave’: grind the skull with gravel until it is smooth. ‘Rāhu’s mouth’: Rāhu was the titan who swallows the sun and moon ([sn2.8](), [sn2.9]()); in this punishment they forced open the mouth with a skewer, put in oil and wick, and light it. ‘Garland of fire’: the body was smeared with oil and set alight. ‘Burning hand’: the hand is wrapped with oiled rags and set alight. ‘Grass blades’: the skin is flayed from the neck down, then twisted into a band by which the victim is hung. ‘Bark dress’: the skin is cut in strips and made into a garment. ‘Antelope’: the bound victim is pinned to the ground and roasted alive. ‘Meat hook’: flaying with double fish-hooks. ‘Coins’: disks of flesh like coins are cut off. ‘Caustic pickle’: after being beaten, the wounds are rubbed with caustic or acidic solution. ‘Twisting bar’: the victim is pinned to the ground by his ears and twirled by his feet. ‘Straw mat’: the body is beaten until every bone is broken and it becomes limp as a mattress.
