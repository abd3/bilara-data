  "mn13:3.1": "This group of three—_kāma_, _rūpa_, and _vedanā_—is also found at [an3.126]() and [an10.29](), where it also relates to the teachings of outsiders. ",
  "mn13:3.2": "The fact that _rūpa_ is in plural suggests it means “sights” here rather than ”material forms”. ",
  "mn13:3.4": "In questioning this, the wanderers display better discernment than many today, who leap all too readily from the discovery of something in common between religions to the assertion that they are therefore the same. ",
  "mn13:4.3": "This is the quintessential Buddhist attitude when encountering something unknown: to neither accept nor reject, but inquire. ",
  "mn13:11.1": "Sisters don’t fight with sisters. ",

  "mn13:13.1": "Bastions were “wetly plastered” (_addāvalepana_) for resistance from fire ([sn35.243:7.1]()). ",
  "mn13:13.2": "Readings here are highly uncertain. BB evidently follows PTS reading pakkaṭṭhī, but see the doubts expressed by PTS dict for that word. VRI comm has Chakaṇakāyāti kuthitagomayena. Given that the parallel passage at Cnd 199 has chakaṇaṭī, it seems pakkaṭṭhī is likely a back-reading from the comm. MA 99 and T 53 have “molten copper” 融銅, while EA 21.9 has 消鐵相灑 (translated by pasadika as “molten iron” (?)). But I am not sure what these are rendering. Excrement of various sorts was commonly used to defend castles. It may well have been hot, but if we accept chakaṇakā, the text does not say hot. Abhivagga is equally obscure. Pali has it only here, and Skt only knows it in the sense of circuit, compass. Comm says “satadanta”, which is no less obscure. Does it refer to some multi-pronged weapon? Mahabharata has a śataghnī, “a stone or cylindrical piece of wood studded with iron spikes”. My sense is that if it meant something generic like BB’s “heavy weight” we would not find it used only here. "
