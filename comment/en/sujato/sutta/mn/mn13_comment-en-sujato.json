  "mn13:3.1": "This group of three—_kāma_, _rūpa_, and _vedanā_—is also found at [an3.126]() and [an10.29](), where it also relates to the teachings of outsiders. ",
  "mn13:3.2": "The fact that _rūpa_ is in plural suggests it means “sights” here rather than ”material forms”. ",
  "mn13:3.4": "In questioning this, the wanderers display better discernment than many today, who leap all too readily from the discovery of something in common between religions to the assertion that they are therefore the same. ",
  "mn13:4.3": "This is the quintessential Buddhist attitude when encountering something unknown: to neither accept nor reject, but inquire. ",
  "mn13:11.1": "Sisters don’t fight with sisters. ",
  "mn13:12.1": "",
  "mn13:13.1": "Bastions were “wetly plastered” (_addāvalepana_) for resistance from fire ([sn35.243:7.1]()). ",
  "mn13:13.2": "For “splashed with dung” (_chakaṇakāyapi osiñcanti_), PTS reads _pakkaṭṭhī_, but this word is dubious. The commentary says _chakaṇakā_ means “boiling cowdung”, but nothing in the word itself suggests “boiling”. The Chinese parallels at MA 99 and T 53 have “molten copper” <span lang='lzh'>融銅</span>, while EA 21.9 has “molten iron” (<span lang='lzh'>消鐵</span>). | _Abhivagga_ is only found here in Pali. The Atharvaveda (3.5.2, 6.54.2, 11.2.4) has _abhīvarga_ apparently in the sense of “domain”. The commentary says _abhivagga_ was a “hundred-toothed” weapon that crushed invaders of a castle. However, _vagga_ has the recognized military sense of “cadre, company, platoon”, so I take _abhivagga_ to mean “superior force”. "
