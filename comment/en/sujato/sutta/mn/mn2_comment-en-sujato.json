  "mn2:1.1": "Both the Dīghanikāya and Majjhimanikāya open with a difficult philosophical text (Brahmajālasutta, Mūlapariyāyasutta) and follow them with a more practical teaching (Sāmaññaphalasutta, Sabbāsavasutta). ",
  "mn2:2.1": "This opening follows the pattern of [mn1](). ",
  "mn2:3.1": "The “ending of defilements” (_āsavānaṁ khayaṁ_) is a common Sutta term for arahantship. | “Knowing and seeing” refers to the penetrating insight that arises from meditative immersion (_samādhi_, eg. [an5.168:2.2](), [an10.2:2.3](), [sn12.23:6.18](), [dn2:83.1]()). ",
  "mn2:3.3": "“Rational application of mind” (_yoniso manasikāra_) is a distinctively Buddhist term. It draws on the frequent Vedic image of the “womb of truth” (_yonāv ṛtasya_, Rig Veda 9.13.9), the source of the laws and patterns that govern the natural order. The idea is that by applying the mind by way of cause or reason the hidden truth can be uncovered. Here the meditator’s insight is framed not as uncovering the objective truth about the world, but as reflexively understanding the means of insight itself. ",
  "mn2:3.4": "This passage and the next are comparable to the contemplation of the principles of the five hindrances and the seven awakening factors respectively in the fourth section of mindfulness meditation (_dhammānupassanā_; see [mn10:36.4]()). ",
  "mn2:4.1": "Here the Buddha gives the scheme of the Sutta: seven methods for getting rid of defilements. This diversity of practices argues against a simplistic one-size-fits-all approach to meditation and spiritual development. The mind is diverse so the means of cultivating the mind are diverse. ",
  "mn2:7.3": "These are existential questions framed from a metaphysical perspective, i.e. they are based on the underlying assumption of a self. They are “irrational” because they avoid the question of cause: they only ask *what* happens, not *why* it happens. ",
  "mn2:8.1": "To wonder is natural, but when we take speculations seriously they become dogmas, insisted on as the truth, though in reality we have no way of knowing. ",
  "mn2:8.2": "See the discussion on the “self” at [sn44.10](), and “gods” at [mn100:42.4](). All three passages are phrased the same way. In each case the question, drawing on the doubts about the past and future as depicted above, is whether the self continues to exist (_atthi_) or not (_natthi_) after death. ",
  "mn2:8.4": "Compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.23, which, in a discussion of the hereafter, says that a sage who is tamed and stilled (_samāhito_) “sees the self in the self” _ātmanyevātmānaṁ paśyati_). Note the different verb here; unlike the Upaniṣad, the Sutta is not speaking of a sage who “sees” but of a theorist who “perceives”. ",
  "mn2:8.5": "The method of negation was employed by Yājñavalkya to discard false, shallow views of the Self: “This Self is that which is not that, not that” (_sa eṣa neti netyātmā_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.15, etc.). ",
  "mn2:8.6": "The theorist still relies on perception (_saññā_) and hence does not see the Self, which is pure _viññāṇa_ cognized by _viññāṇa_: “Through what should one know the Knower?” (_vijñātāramare kena vijānīyāt_). ",
  "mn2:8.8": "This phrase is reminiscent of Yājñavalkya’s discussion of the self as a person’s “light” in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. He illustrates the departure of the Self from the body at death by analogy with dreams, where a person sets aside the physical body and takes up a body of light (4.3.9). There (_tatra_) he is the “agent” (_kartā_, 4.3.10) who “moves between the worlds contemplating and playing, as it were” (4.3.7). He creates his own experiences, seeing good and bad (_dṛṣṭvaiva puṇyaṃ ca pāpaṃ ca_, 4.3.15). Being “immortal” (_amṛto_, 4.3.12), he wanders where he likes and returns unaffected (4.3.16). ",
  "mn2:8.9": "For these terms, see my note on [sn12.35:5.1](). The idea of thicket and desert is that they are without nourishment or fruit, you lose your way. I think the underlying metaphor of visuka and vippandita here is that the views are essentially illusions, dodges or tricks of the mind to convince you that you understand, are in control. But it is just endless flopping back and forth. ",
  "mn2:19.3": "BB has “suspect” for okappeti, however this means rather the opposite, to “believe, hold, trust”. Cone takes this in the sense I mention. Thanks to Brahmali for pointing this out. "
