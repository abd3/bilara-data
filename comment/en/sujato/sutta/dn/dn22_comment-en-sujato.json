  "dn22:1.1": "This discourse is copied from [mn10]() with the section on the four noble truths expanded, mostly with material drawn from [mn141](). These discourses are the most influential texts for modern Theravada meditation, prompting countless modern commentaries. ",
  "dn22:1.7": "The phrase _ekāyano maggo_ (“path to convergence”) is given multiple meanings in commentaries and ancient translations. Outside of _satipaṭṭhāna_ it is used in only one context in Pali, where a man is walking on a path that “meets with” a pit of coals ([mn12:37.5]()). At [sn47.18:3.4]() the phrase is spoken by Brahmā, which strongly suggests it was a Brahmanical term. And while it is found in old Sanskrit texts in a number of senses, by far the most significant use is at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.11, where it means a place where things come together or converge. The dialogue that contains this passage is full of references, images, and ideas that are also found in the Suttas, confirming that it was known and responded to by early Buddhists. Thus the meaning is that _satipaṭṭhāna_ is a practice that leads to everything “coming together as one”, in other words, it is the basis for _samādhi_ or _jhāna_ ([mn44:12.3]()). "
