  "dn22:1.1": "This discourse is copied from [mn10]() with the section on the four noble truths expanded, mostly with material drawn from [mn141](). These discourses are the most influential texts for modern Theravada meditation, prompting countless modern commentaries. While mindfulness is always useful ([sn46.53:15.4]()), the “establishment of mindfulness” (_satipaṭṭhāna_) refers especially to a conscious development of contemplative practices based on mindfulness, i.e. “mindfulness meditation”. ",
  "dn22:1.7": "The phrase _ekāyano maggo_ (“path to convergence”) is given multiple meanings in commentaries and ancient translations. Outside of _satipaṭṭhāna_ it is used in only one context in Pali, where it means to “meets with” ([mn12:37.5]()). At [sn47.18:3.4]() the phrase is spoken by Brahmā, which suggests it was a Brahmanical term. At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.11—a passage full of details shared with the Suttas—it means a place where things come together or converge. Thus _satipaṭṭhāna_ leads to everything “coming together as one”. In other words, as seventh factor of the noble eightfold path, it leads to _samādhi_, the eighth factor ([sn45.1:3.9](); see also [mn44:12.3]()). ",
  "dn22:1.9": "The idiom _kāye kāyānupassī_, literally “observes a body in the body” refers to focusing on a specific aspect of embodied experience, such as the breath, the postures, etc. “Keen” (_ātāpī_) implies effort, while “aware” (_sampajāno_) is the wisdom of understanding situation and context. “Covetousness and bitterness” (_abhijjhādomanassaṁ_) are the strong forms of desire and aversion that are overcome by sense restraint in preparation for meditation. ",
  "dn22:1.10": "“Feelings” (_vedanā_) are the basic tones of pleasant, painful, or neutral, not the complexes we call “emotions”. ",
  "dn22:1.11": "“Mind” (_citta_) is simple awareness. In meditation contexts, “mind” is often similar in meaning to _samādhi_. ",
  "dn22:1.12": "“Principles” (_dhammā_) are the natural “systems” of cause and effect that underlie the “teachings”. As the detailed context later makes clear, the renderings “mind objects” or “mental qualities” are incorrect, as many of the things spoken of are not mind objects or mental qualities. “Phenomena” is a possible translation, but the emphasis is not on the “appearance” of things, but on their conditional relations. ",
  "dn22:2.2": "The context here—a mendicant gone to the forest—establishes that this practice takes place in the wider context of the Gradual Training. Indeed, this whole sutta can be understood as an expansion of the phrase mentioned in passing at dn2:67.3](). ",
  "dn22:2.3": "The most fundamental meditation instruction in Buddhism. Notice how the Buddha phrases it: not “concentrate on the breath” as an object, but rather “breathing” as an activity to which one brings mindfulness. ",
  "dn22:2.4": "The stages of breath meditation are not meant to be done deliberately, but to be observed and understood as the natural process of deepening meditation. When starting out, the breath is somewhat rough and coarse. ",
  "dn22:2.5": "Over time, the breath becomes more subtle and soft. ",
  "dn22:2.6": "Contextually the idiom “whole body” (_sabbakāya_) here refers to the breath, marking the fuller and more continuous awareness that arises with tranquility. Some practitioners, however, interpret it as the “whole physical body”, broadening awareness to encompass the movement and settling of energies throughout the body. ",
  "dn22:2.7": "The “physical process” (_kāyasaṅkhāraṁ_) is the breath ([sn41.6:1.8]()). ",
  "dn22:2.8": "Text has “long” and “short”, but “deep” and “shallow” are more idiomatic for describing the breath in English. ",
  "dn22:2.11": "“Internally” is one’s own body, “externally” the bodies of others, or external physical phenomena. This distinction is applied broadly in Buddhist meditation, but it is more relevant in some contexts than others. In the case of the breath, one is obviously focusing on one’s own breath, but when contemplating, say, a dead body, or the material elements, there is more of an external dimension. Starting with the conventional distinction between “me” in here and the “world” out there, this practice dissolves the distinction so that we see we are of the same nature as everything else. ",
  "dn22:2.12": "This is the _vipassanā_ (“insight” or “discernment”) dimension of meditation, observing not just the rise and fall of phenomena, but also their conditioned “nature” as being “liable” (_-dhamma_) to impermanence. The meaning of this passage is explained at ([sn47.42]()). Apart from this, _vipassanā_ is rarely mentioned in the context of _satipaṭṭhāna_. ",
  "dn22:2.13": "Mindfulness meditation leads to a range of knowledges as detailed by Anuruddha at [sn52.6]() and [sn52.11]()–24. An arahant is “independent” of any attachment (eg. [mn143]()), but _satipaṭṭhāna_ is also taught to give up dependency on views of the past and future ([dn29:40.1]()). ",
  "dn22:3.1": "In early Pali, this practice is found only in the two Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the closely related Kāyagatāsatisutta ([mn119]()). It is practiced by developing a reflexive awareness of one’s posture and activity as it proceeds, often assisted by moving slowly and carefully. ",
  "dn22:4.1": "“Situational awareness” (_sampajañña_) understands the context and purpose of activities. The main examples here illustrate the activities of daily monastic life: leaving the monastery on almsround, restraint while in the town, care wearing the robes, then mindfully eating and going to the toilet. ",
  "dn22:5.1": "This practice is intended to counter sexual desire and obsession. The primary focus is on one’s own body, the other’s body, although that can be brought in also. By focusing on aspects of our body that we normally prefer to ignore, we move towards a healthy sense of acceptance and neutrality towards our body. ",
  "dn22:5.2": "Thirty-one parts are mentioned in early texts, later expanded to thirty-two with the addition of the “brain” (_matthaluṅga_). ",
  "dn22:5.3": "The “bag with openings at both ends” is the body. The identification of specific varieties of grains and beans is sometimes speculative. ",
  "dn22:6.1": "While meditation on the elements is commonly taught in early texts, this phrasing is found only in the two Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the  Kāyagatāsatisutta. Detailed instructions are found in such suttas as [mn28]() and [mn140](). This meditation works in any posture, whereas breath meditation is best done sitting, to allow the breath to become still. ",
  "dn22:6.2": "The “elements” are the four states of matter as represented by their primary material example and their dominant property: earth as a solid with the property of resisting or upholding; water as a liquid with the property of binding; air as a gas with the property of movement; and fire (“heat” or “energy”) as plasma with the property of transformation. ",
  "dn22:6.3": "This gruesome image shows that butchery of cows was a normal feature of Indian life at the time. ",
  "dn22:7.1": "Cremation was the respectful form of funeral, but in some cases considered inauspicious the body would be left for the animals, for example, when criminals were executed. This is still seen in some places today, and monastics occasionally take the opportunity to practice meditation beside a corpse. However the wording of the Pali sounds like an imaginative exercise. ",
  "dn22:7.2": "The observed corpse is not gendered. The purpose is not to become repulsed by an objectified other, but to understand the mortality of one’s own body. ",
  "dn22:10.3": "It takes a decade or more for bones to rot to powder, again suggesting it is an imaginative contemplation. ",
  "dn22:11.1": "Again, this is literally “a feeling among the feelings”, and the practice shows that the meditator contemplates specific feelings as they occur. "
