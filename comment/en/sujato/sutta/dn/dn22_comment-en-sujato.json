  "dn22:1.1": "This discourse is copied from [mn10]() with the section on the four noble truths expanded, mostly with material drawn from [mn141](). These discourses are the most influential texts for modern Theravada meditation, prompting countless modern commentaries. ",
  "dn22:1.7": "The phrase _ekāyano maggo_ (“path to convergence”) is given multiple meanings in commentaries and ancient translations. Outside of _satipaṭṭhāna_ it is used in only one context in Pali, where a man is walking on a path that “meets with” a pit of coals ([mn12:37.5]()). At [sn47.18:3.4]() the phrase is spoken by Brahmā, which suggests it was a Brahmanical term. At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.11—a passage full of references, images, and ideas that are also found in the Suttas—it means a place where things come together or converge. Thus _satipaṭṭhāna_ leads to everything “coming together as one”. In other words, as seventh factor of the noble eightfold path, it leads to _samādhi_, the eighth factor ([sn45.1:3.9](); see also [mn44:12.3]()). "
