  "dn22:1.1": "This discourse is copied from [mn10]() with the section on the four noble truths expanded, mostly with material drawn from [mn141](). These discourses are the most influential texts for modern Theravada meditation, prompting countless modern commentaries. While mindfulness is always useful ([sn46.53:15.4]()), the “establishment of mindfulness” (_satipaṭṭhāna_) refers especially to a conscious development of contemplative practices based on mindfulness, i.e. “mindfulness meditation”. ",
  "dn22:1.7": "The phrase _ekāyano maggo_ (“path to convergence”) is given multiple meanings in commentaries and ancient translations. Outside of _satipaṭṭhāna_ it is used in only one context in Pali, where it means to “meets with” ([mn12:37.5]()). At [sn47.18:3.4]() the phrase is spoken by Brahmā, which suggests it was a Brahmanical term. At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.11—a passage full of details shared with the Suttas—it means a place where things come together or converge. Thus _satipaṭṭhāna_ leads to everything “coming together as one”. In other words, as seventh factor of the noble eightfold path, it leads to _samādhi_, the eighth factor ([sn45.1:3.9](); see also [mn44:12.3]()). ",
  "dn22:1.9": "The idiom _kāye kāyānupassī_, literally “observes a body in the body” refers to focusing on a specific aspect of embodied experience, such as the breath, the postures, etc. “Keen” (_ātāpī_) implies effort, while “aware” (_sampajāno_) is the wisdom of understanding situation and context. “Covetousness and bitterness” (_abhijjhādomanassaṁ_) are the strong forms of desire and aversion that are overcome by sense restraint in preparation for meditation. ",
  "dn22:1.10": "“Feelings” (_vedanā_) are the basic tones of pleasant, painful, or neutral, not the complexes we call “emotions”. ",
  "dn22:1.11": "“Mind” (_citta_) is simple awareness. In meditation contexts, “mind” is often similar in meaning to _samādhi_. ",
  "dn22:1.12": "“Principles” (_dhammā_) are the natural “systems” of cause and effect that underlie the “teachings”. As the detailed context later makes clear, the renderings “mind objects” or “mental qualities” are incorrect, as many of the things spoken of are not mind objects or mental qualities. “Phenomena” is a possible translation, but the emphasis is not on the “appearance” of things, but on their conditional relations. ",
  "dn22:2.2": "The context here—a mendicant gone to the forest—establishes that this practice takes place in the wider context of the Gradual Training. Indeed, this whole sutta can be understood as an expansion of the phrase mentioned in passing at dn2:67.3](). ",
  "dn22:2.3": "The most fundamental meditation instruction in Buddhism. Notice how the Buddha phrases it: not “concentrate on the breath” as an object, but rather “breathing” as an activity to which one brings mindfulness. ",
  "dn22:2.4": "The stages of breath meditation are not meant to be done deliberately, but to be observed and understood as the natural process of deepening meditation. When starting out, the breath is somewhat rough and coarse. ",
  "dn22:2.5": "Over time, the breath becomes more subtle and soft. ",
  "dn22:2.6": "Contextually the idiom “whole body” (_sabbakāya_) here refers to the breath, marking the fuller and more continuous awareness that arises with tranquility. Some practitioners, however, interpret it as the “whole physical body”, broadening awareness to encompass the movement and settling of energies throughout the body. ",
  "dn22:2.7": "The “physical process” (_kāyasaṅkhāraṁ_) is the breath ([sn41.6:1.8]()). ",
  "dn22:2.8": "I use “deep” and “shallow” for the text’s “long” and “short”, as those are not natural idioms for describing the breath in English. ",
  "dn22:2.11": "“Internally” is one’s own body, “externally” the bodies of others, or external physical phenomena. This distinction is applied broadly in Buddhist meditation, but it is more relevant in some contexts than others. In the case of the breath, one is obviously focusing on one’s own breath, but when contemplating, say, a dead body, or the material elements, there is more of an external dimension. "
