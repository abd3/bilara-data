  "dn19:1.3": "We were introduced to Pañcasikha in [dn18](), which is similar to the current sutta in many other details as well. Thus this sutta can be considered as a distant cousin to the Mahāparinibbāna cycle. ",
  "dn19:2.1": "The similar council of gods described by Janavasabha at [dn18:12.1]() took place at the entry to a rainy season, whereas this one is at the end of a rainy season. It can’t have been the Buddha’s last rains, for he was already in Vajji by then. ",
  "dn19:4.2": "For “genuine praise” (_yathābhucce vaṇṇe_), see [dn1:1.28.1](). ",
  "dn19:4.4": "This set of eight is not found elsewhere. “Proffered” is _payirudāhāsi_, a unique term in early texts. ",

  "dn19:8.1": "_Paṭipadā_ is instrumental. ",
  "dn19:8.2": "I don’t think this idea is found elsewhere in quite this way. Normally it is said that the path leads to Nibbāna like the rivers lead to the ocean (eg. [sn45.114:1.1]()). ",
  "dn19:9.1": "This item is unique. ",
  "dn19:10.1": "Another unique item. ",
  "dn19:10.2": "This is normally true, but in some cases the Buddha left a badly-behaved community ([mn48]()), dismissed misbehaving monks (eg. [an8.10:2.2]()), or even dismissed a large community ([mn67]()). The “joy of solitude” is _ekārāmataṁ _. ",
  "dn19:11.1": "Also at [dn29:29.5](), [an4.23:4.1](), and [iti112:5.1](). ",
  "dn19:12.1": "_Pariyositasaṅkappo_ (“achieved all he wished for”) is a synonym of the more common _paripuṇṇasaṅkappo_ (eg. [mn29:2.5]()). ",
  "dn19:14.2": "This impossibility is also at [an1.277:1.1]() and [mn115:14.1](). “In one solar system” (_ekissā lokadhātuyā_): a single _lokadhātu_ encompasses a single terrestrial world with a single moon and sun. ",
  "dn19:14.3": "It is not common to wish for the Buddha’s long life, but we do find this sentiment expressed in a conversation between Sāriputta and Ānanda ([sn21.2:3.5]()). ",
  "dn19:19.2": "“Having assessed” (_saṅkhāya_) is glossed by the commentary with “having known” (_jānitvā_). ",
  "dn19:29.1": "This story tells of the spread of Aryan culture from Videha across India. Disampati means “head of the directions”, i.e. king of all the land. He and his story are found nowhere else in the early texts. ",
  "dn19:29.2": "“Steward” is Govinda, literally “lord of cows”. The “high priest” (_purohita_) was a hereditary office, a learned ritualist and adviser attached to a specific family. For royal families the post could be highly contested. The closeness of the role is shown in that aristocratic families could be referred to by the lineage of the high priest. ",
  "dn19:29.3": "Reṇu is not encountered anywhere else. ",
  "dn19:29.4": "Jotipāla means “guardian of the sacred flame”, i.e. someone who maintains the Vedic fire ritual. There was another Jotipāla in the time of Buddha Kassapa at [mn81:6.2](), and another who was a religious founder of the past at [an6.54:18.1](). ",
  "dn19:29.7": "",
  "dn19:29.8": "The king’s only care, it seems, is not for the passing of his friend, but that he no longer gets to indulge in whatever he wants. ",
  "dn19:30.9": "This shows that Govinda is an office rather than a personal name. ",
  "dn19:31.2": "Following the Mahāsaṅgīti reading rather than the PTS (_nānusāsi … nānusāsati_). It seems required by the context that he does more than his father. ",
  "dn19:33.7": "Following PTS reading _sukhaṁ edheyyātha_. ",
  "dn19:34.13": "The meaning of _sakaṭamukhaṁ_ (“front of a cart”) is clarified by comparison with the Chinese texts here. T 8 is identical (<span lang='lzh'>其界廣闊。正南南隅，其界狹略，猶如車形</span>), while DA 3 expresses a similar idea more briefly (<span lang='lzh'>此閻浮提地， 內廣外狹</span>). The Mahāvastu (Mvu 85.17) confirms this sense with _dakṣiṇena saṁkṣiptā śakaṭamukhasaṁsthitaṁ_. These appears to demonstrate a knowledge of the shape of the Indian subcontinent. Below it says that each of the kingdoms is shaped like the front of a cart, rather than India as a whole; the relation between these ideas is not clear to me. ",
  "dn19:36.1": "Neither Rhys Davids nor Walshe translate this line, but it receives an extensive discussion in the commentary. It says that six kingdoms were arranged around Reṇu’s kingdom in the middle, like an umbrella (_vitānasadisaṁ_). ",
  "dn19:36.2": "The text previously identified Renu’s land as Videha, but Videha is north of the other realms and there is no way they could be arranged around it. The verses tell the realms starting with the rising sun in Kaliṅga in the east and proceeding clockwise (_padakkhiṇā_) until the circle is complete with Aṅga, on the Kaliṅga border. Thus the original center was probably the last place on the list, Kāsi, which is indeed geographically central. The Dīpavamsa (iii 40) records Disampati and Reṇu as kings of Kāsi, which must stem from a separate, and apparently older, source. ",
  "dn19:36.3": "Kaliṅga was a coastal realm in modern Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. There is no consensus on the exact location of Dantapura. ",
  "dn19:36.4": "Assaka stretched from Kaliṅga’s western border across the interior. Potana is modern Bodhan in Telangana state. ",
  "dn19:36.5": "_Mahesaya_ is a variant spelling for _māhissatī_. Mahāvastu has _māhiṣmatī_. It is in present-day Madhya Pradesh, on the banks of Narmada River, and is perhaps to be identified with modern Maheshwar. ",
  "dn19:36.6": "Sovīra was on the lower Indus, and Roruka is identified with modern Rohri in Sindh province, Pakistan. It is most unlikely that they received Aryan culture from Videha. ",
  "dn19:36.13": "The names of the aristocrats are listed in an abruptly-inserted verse. Rhys Davids proposes to assign each one to a kingdom as listed in the same order, but no text or commentary says this explicitly. Most of these kings are difficult to identify from other sources. The names of the kings are missing from the Mahāvastu and DA 3, but the parallel at T 8 appears to have the same list of names. ",
  "dn19:36.14": "“Bharata” is the name of an individual king, while they are collectively known as “Bhāratas” with a long initial _ā_ due to secondary derivation. [ja424](), invoking this sutta, identifies Bharata as king of Sovīra. ",
  "dn19:36.16": "Here _bhāratā_ must mean “kings of India”. India was called Bhārata after the legendary King Bharata of Hastināpura (Delhi), founder of the Lunar dynasty, conqueror of India, and sire of the warring tribes of the Mahābharata. His story is told in the Saṁbhavapara of the Mahābhārata. ",
  "dn19:45.12": "_Brahme_ is the normal vocative for _brahmā_. However in verse it is sometimes used as vocative for _brāhmaṇa_, too. See Snp 5.6, Ja 456, and several other Jatakas. ",
  "dn19:46.17": "PTS, followed by RD and MW, read vicikiccha, which is evidently a mistake. comm: taṇhālakkhaṇā icchā ca, macchariyalakkhaṇā vivicchā ca ",
