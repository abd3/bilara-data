  "dn27:1.2": "After the Jetavana, this was the best-known monastery in Sāvatthī. It was offered by the lady Visākhā, known as Migāra’s mother. ",
  "dn27:1.3": "We met Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja as the students of Pakkharasāti and Tārukkha respectively in [dn13](), at the end of which they went for refuge. Some time later they must have asked for ordination. The commentary says that (_paravasati_) was required, not because they had previously gone forth in other sects  (as the naked ascetic Kassapa at [dn8:24.1]() or the wanderer Subhadda at [dn16:5.29.1]()), nor because they had committed an offence, but because they were not yet the required twenty years of age. ",
  "dn27:2.1": "Here as in [dn13]() Vāseṭṭha takes the lead. ",
  "dn27:4.6": "The Buddha gives a rationalist critique of Vedic myth (see also [mn93:5.9]()), the fairness of which is not easy to assess. Within the Brahmanical world, especially the progressive Kosalan brahmins to whom Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja belonged, there had been a shift towards a more nuanced symbolic understanding of such claims. Yet the subtle distinctions of the philosophers rarely influence the more straightforward beliefs of the common practitioner. ",
  "dn27:4.9": "Brahmins assumed the superiority of the fair-skinned northerners of Indo-Aryan descent over the dark-skinned natives (see [dn3:1.10.3]()). ",
  "dn27:5.4": "“Dark” (_kaṇha_) and “bright” (or “light”, _sukka_) are redefined in ethical not racial terms. ",
  "dn27:7.8": "Vedic theory claimed that the caste system was part of the order of nature (_dhamma_) established by Brahmā, and hence to follow the obligations of caste was a duty (also _dhamma_). The Buddha posited a higher “principle” (_dhamma_) beyond caste. The English word “principle” carries the senses of a fundamental law; a code of conduct; a devotion to right living; a source; and an underlying faculty, all of which are aspects of _dhamma_ in this passage. ",
  "dn27:8.3": "A great king such as Pasenadi ruled his central realm, while outlying districts pledged allegiance to him, enjoying royal protection while ceding some sovereignty. It is the same relationship described for the kingdoms subsumed under the Wheel-Turning Monarch (eg. [dn17:1.9.5]()). The Buddha described his people as natives among the Kosalans at [snp3.1:18.4](). ",
  "dn27:8.5": "The Mahāsaṅgīti reading _na naṁ_ yields a better sense than the PTS _nanu_, which would make this a question. ",
  "dn27:9.4": "The Buddha adapts the Brahmanical rhetoric of birth from the “mouth of Brahmā”. Having criticized them for taking this literally he employs it in a metaphorical sense. ",
  "dn27:9.6": "“The embodiment of principle” is _dhammakāya_. This is a term of unique occurrence in the suttas, which was seized on in later days to posit a metaphysical theory of a quasi-eternal Buddha. In the suttas, it means that he, having practiced the Dhamma to its fullest, embodies the qualities of the Dhamma to the highest degree. ",
  "dn27:10.1": "Here begins the story of origins. The Buddha begins his creation myth with the end of the world. For this passage, compare [dn1:2.2.1](). ",
  "dn27:10.5": "In the Brahmajālasutta, beings pass from one Brahmā realm to another, but when they come to this world it is as a human. Here we have a different perspective, where beings apparently still like the Brahmā gods exist in the physical realm. ",
  "dn27:10.6": "The role of food is critical throughout this narrative. Food is a fundamental sustenance on which all creatures must rely, and the nature of the food reflects the type of creature that eats it. Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.5.1 says the highest form of self is made of bliss (_ātmā ānandamaya_). ",
  "dn27:11.1": "Creation myths often begin with a dark, formless world of water, and describe the emergence of divisions and structures of the world. They do not differentiate the physical, biological, ecological, or social, as all such distinctions came later. ",
  "dn27:11.3": "The reading and sense of _samatani_ is obscure. I think it is connected with _santānaka_ in the next line, in the sense of “networks” or tendrils appearing in the water as it curdles. The Sanskrit at SF 277 and Mūlasarvāstvāda Vinaya 17 has _saṁmūrcchitaḥ saṁtanoti_ (“curdled tendrils”). _Rasapathavī_ (“earth’s nectar”) is also obscure. We would expect _pathavīrasa_ (cp. _phalarasa_ “fruit juice”, etc.), which is indeed found at [sn5.9:5.3]() in the sense “nutriments in soil”. Since this reading also appears here in the Sanskrit sources, I assume it is the correct sense. ",
  "dn27:11.7": "_Khuddā_ (literally “small one”) is said to be a species of small bee, also known in Sanskrit as _kṣudrā_. The “dwarf bee” (_apis florea_) fits the bill, as it is a small wild honeybee found in India. ",
  "dn27:11.10": "Ghee and honey were among the finest offerings to the gods. The soma was often described as “honeyed”. Our text is suggesting that the Vedic sacrifices led to the corruption of divinity. ",
  "dn27:11.11": "For _acchadesi_ read _assādesi_ (“enjoyed”) after Mu Kd 17’s _āsvādayati_. The commentary explains _acchadesi_ as “becomes suffused”, so if it is a misreading it is an old one. ",
  "dn27:13.4": "At [dn26:17.2]() it is the ugly ones who are at fault for jealousy. ",
  "dn27:13.12": "This is another veiled critique of the Vedic tradition. In [dn13:13.1]() the Buddha told Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja the Vedas were recited by people who did not understand them. This problem was well understood within the tradition of the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, which constantly emphasized that they are effective for “one who knows this” (_ya evam veda_). ",
  "dn27:14.1": "“Fungus” is _pappaṭaka_ (Sanskrit _parpaṭaka_). At [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.5](), Moggallāna suggests that, to alleviate famine, the monks might eat the _pappaṭakojaṁ_ (“fungus-nutrition”) under the earth. Given that it is compared to a mushroom, I think it is the fungal mycelia of a mycorrhizal network. Such fungi spread like tendrils underground, sometimes appearing above the surface, sharing nutrients and information between organisms. ",
  "dn27:14.13": "Readings and meaning of _padālatā_ are uncertain. It has usually been understood that the second element is _latā_ (“creeper”). But this leaves _padā_ unexplained, and the commentary’s gloss of _bhaddālatā_ is unconvincing. It also leaves unexplained the connection with _kalambukā_. This is probably the fruit of the kadam tree—fleshy, yellow-orange capsules with about 8000 seeds that split apart when ripe. I think _padālatā_ is related to _padālana_ in the sense of “bursting”: a seed pod that splits open like a fig or pomegranate. ",
  "dn27:16.7": "The commentary to [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.6.1]() explains “male characteristics” as “beard and whiskers, etc.” (_massudāṭhikādi_), so this is not just genitals but also secondary sex characteristics. ",
  "dn27:16.11": "Pali _seṭṭhi_ is explained by the commentary as “ash” (_chārikā_), although this sense does not seem to be attested anywhere else. Mahāvastu has _leṣṭu_ while Mu Kd 17 has _loṣṭa_, both explained as “clod”. Given that it is easier to throw a clod than ash, I think these probably convey the correct sense. ",
  "dn27:16.12": "_Nassa_ could mean “die!” or “get lost”; I take the softer meaning. Killing has not yet appeared among these beings. This behavior looks much like scapegoating rituals, where certain members of the community are deemed to bear the sins of all and are sacrificed to erase the sin. Often the victim was expelled from the community, temporarily or permanently. ",
  "dn27:16.13": "Mob shaming over perceived sexual transgression is the most primitive form of moralizing. ",
  "dn27:16.14": "“Carrying off” (_nibbuyhamānā_) like being swept away by a river. Mu Kd 17 says they throw powder, scent, garlands, and nets, while wishing the bride happiness and well-being. ",
  "dn27:17.1": "“Unprincipled” is _adhamma_. In the past the lovers were spurned, now they are celebrated in marriage. ",
  "dn27:17.4": "The sight of others having sex provokes strong reactions of arousal, jealousy, and disgust, often leading to violence. A culture of sexual modesty regulates these emotions, promoting the growth of larger societal structures. ",
  "dn27:17.7": "Human society evolves first from greed, second from sexual desire, and third from laziness. The effort to avoid manual labor drives cultural and technological innovation. ",
  "dn27:17.12": "Humans are focused on short term comforts and ignore long term consequences. ",
  "dn27:17.23": "The wild grasses used as grains evolve in adaptation to human needs. ",
  "dn27:18.2": "The beings tell their story within the story. The oldest myths, such as the Vedas or Gilgamesh, speak of myths that were already ancient for them. And the oldest story of all is the Fall: how much better things were in the old days. Here _pāpa_ has an older meaning of “bad, evil, wicked” things in the world, rather than the Buddhist notion that wickedness comes from our intentions. ",
  "dn27:18.27": "Scarcity has arisen because of greed, giving rise to agriculture and land ownership. ",
  "dn27:19.1": "With ownership and inequality come theft. ",
  "dn27:20.3": "khiyati = object to accuse, hardly “show anger” as per RD and MW. ",
  "dn27:20.6": "Note that the ehi formula is the same as original ordination. ",
  "dn27:21.1": "Upanibbatta is unknown elsewhere, and given that it is consistently used in different way than abhinibbatti, I would think there is some nuance of meaning distinguishing them. Clearly it doesn’t mean “first word” as they have been using language before. Mu Kd 17 here has saṁjñodapādi, “arisen by agreement”. I take the distinction to be that these terms were consciously invented and applied in this context, “closely” (upa-) or specifically for them. Comm has na kevalaṁ akkharameva, which may lend some support this idea. ",
  "dn27:22.3": "Read bāheti. ",
  "dn27:22.6": "Comm has “Vītaṅgārāvītadhūmāti pacitvā khāditabbābhāvato vigatadhūmaṅgārā” See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/an-extremely-dense-four-words/6049 ",
  "dn27:23.1": "Cp. DN 3 ",
  "dn27:26.1": "A rare use of dhamma in this sense. "
