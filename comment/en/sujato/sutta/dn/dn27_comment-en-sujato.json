  "dn27:1.2": "After the Jetavana, this was the best-known monastery in Sāvatthī. It was offered by the lady Visākhā, known as Migāra’s mother. ",
  "dn27:1.3": "We met Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja as the students of Pakkharasāti and Tārukkha respectively in [dn13](), at the end of which they went for refuge. Some time later they must have asked for ordination. The commentary says that (_paravasati_) was required, not because they had previously gone forth in other sects  (as the naked ascetic Kassapa at [dn8:24.1]() or the wanderer Subhadda at [dn16:5.29.1]()), nor because they had committed an offence, but because they were not yet the required twenty years of age. ",
  "dn27:4.6": "The Buddha gives a rationalist critique of Vedic myth (see also [mn93:5.9]()), the fairness of which is not easy to assess. Within the Brahmanical world, especially the progressive Kosalan brahmins to whom Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja belonged, there had been a shift towards a more nuanced symbolic understanding of such claims. Yet the subtle distinctions of the philosophers rarely influence the more straightforward beliefs of the common practitioner. ",
  "dn27:4.9": "Brahmins assumed the superiority of the fair-skinned northerners of Indo-Aryan descent over the dark-skinned natives (see [dn3:1.10.3]()). ",
  "dn27:5.4": "“Dark” (_kaṇha_) and “bright” (or “light”, _sukka_) are redefined in ethical not racial terms. ",
  "dn27:7.8": "Vedic theory claimed that the caste system was part of the order of nature (_dhamma_) established by Brahmā, and hence to follow the obligations of caste was a duty (also _dhamma_). The Buddha posited a higher “principle” (_dhamma_) beyond caste. The English word “principle” carries the senses of a fundamental law; a code of conduct; a devotion to right living; a source; and an underlying faculty, all of which are aspects of _dhamma_ in this passage. ",
  "dn27:8.3": "A great king such as Pasenadi ruled his central realm, while outlying districts pledged allegiance to him, enjoying royal protection while ceding some sovereignty. It is the same relationship described for the kingdoms subsumed under the Wheel-Turning Monarch (eg. [dn17:1.9.5]()). The Buddha described his people as natives among the Kosalans at [snp3.1:18.4](). ",
  "dn27:8.5": "The Mahāsaṅgīti reading _na naṁ_ yields a better sense than the PTS _nanu_, which would make this a question. ",
  "dn27:9.4": "The Buddha adapts the Brahmanical rhetoric of birth from the “mouth of Brahmā”. Having criticized them for taking this literally he employs it in a metaphorical sense. ",
  "dn27:9.6": "“The embodiment of principle” is _dhammakāya_. This is a term of unique occurrence in the suttas, which was seized on in later days to posit a metaphysical theory of a quasi-eternal Buddha. In the suttas, it means that he, having practiced the Dhamma to its fullest, embodies the qualities of the Dhamma to the highest degree. ",
  "dn27:10.1": "Here begins the story of origins. The Buddha begins his creation myth with the end of the world. For this passage, compare [dn1:2.2.1](). ",
  "dn27:10.5": "In the Brahmajālasutta, beings pass from one Brahmā realm to another, but when they come to this world it is as a human. Here we have a different perspective, where beings apparently still like the Brahmā gods exist in the physical realm. ",
  "dn27:10.6": "The role of food is critical throughout this narrative. Food is a fundamental sustenance on which all creatures must rely, and the nature of the food reflects the type of creature that eats it. Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.5.1 says the highest form of self is made of bliss (_ātmā ānandamaya_). ",
  "dn27:11.1": "Creation myths often begin with a dark, formless world of water, and describe how the divisions and structures of the world come to be. ",
  "dn27:11.3": "The reading and sense of _samatani_ is obscure. I think it is connected with _santānaka_ in the next line, in the sense of “networks” or tendrils appearing in the water as it curdles. The Sanskrit at SF 277 and Mūlasarvāstvāda Vinaya 17 has _saṁmūrcchitaḥ saṁtanoti_ (“curdled tendrils”). _Rasapathavī_ (“earth’s nectar”) is also obscure. We would expect _pathavīrasa_ (cp. _phalarasa_ “fruit juice”, etc.). [sn5.9:5.3]() does indeed have _pathavīrasa_ in the sense “nutriments in soil”, which is also found here in the Sanskrit sources. I assume this is the correct sense. ",
  "dn27:11.7": "Obviously this is not literally manuka, but it conveys a similar sense of a very flavorful and exotic honey. ",
  "dn27:11.11": "Read assādesi for acchadesi. RD has “became suffused”, following comm “Acchādesīti jivhagge ṭhapitamattā satta rasaharaṇīsahassāni pharitvā manāpā hutvā tiṭṭhati”. However Mu Kd 17 has āsvādayati, as does SF 277 albeit in reconstructed phrases only. This yields a more satisfactory sense, and I propose that an old misreading preceded the commentary. ",
  "dn27:14.1": "I am not sure why there is such uncertainty about pappaṭaka. Surely it must = papaṭikā = Skt prapāṭikā = shoots, sprouts. ",
  "dn27:14.13": "Readings and meaning of padālatā are uncertain. It has usually been understood that the second element = latā creeper. But this leaves the first part unexplained, and comm’s bhaddālatā is unconvincing. It also leaves unexplained the connection with kalambukā, unconvincingly translated by RD and MW as “bamboo”. I think padālatā is related to padālana in the sense of “bursting”. Kalambukā is probably the fruit of the kadam tree, described thus: “small, fleshy capsules packed closely together to form a fleshy yellow-orange infructescence containing approximately 8000 seeds. On maturing, the fruit splits apart”. Thus padālatā would be a kind of bud or seed pod that splits open, somewhat like a fig or pomegranate. ",
  "dn27:16.7": "Comm here offers nothing on what litthi/purisa-linga actually means, but at Pj 1 it says massudāṭhikādi “beard and whiskers, etc.” So it seems this is not restricted to genitals. ",
  "dn27:16.11": "Unless seṭṭhiṁ khipanti means “they threw millionares” I am stumped by this. Comm says “Seṭṭhinti chārikaṁ” which is equally plausible and unsupported. Mu Kd 17 has “pāṁśum api kṣipanti, loṣṭam api śarkarā api kapālāny api”, all of which are earthy: dust, mud lumps, potsherds, etc. Nevertheless, in the absence of anything better I follow comm. ",
  "dn27:16.12": "Nassa could mean “die! “or” get lost”, but I take the softer. ",
  "dn27:16.14": "nibbuyhamānā is unusual, and I think has a stronger meaning than “led”. It is used of being swept away by a river. I think the bride was carried out by the guests. Note that Skt here has cūrṇam api kṣipanti gandham api mālyam api vastrajālāny api kṣipanti, which sounds much more pleasant! ",
  "dn27:17.1": "Comm, echoed by MW, say it is the throwing of dirt that is “adhamma “, hence MW’s cute translation as” bad form”. However, this seems unlikely. Note that the Skt, where only auspicious things are thrown, and where the bride is given only good wishes (sukhinī bhava vadhūke sukhinī bhava vadhūke) is also followed by a similar clause (iti hi gautamā yat pūrvam adharmasaṁmataṁ tad etarhi dharmasaṁmataṁ; yat pūrvam avinayasaṁmataṁ tad etarhi vinayasaṁmataṁ; yat pūrvaṁ garhyasaṁmataṁ tad etarhi praśasyasaṁmatam). Here it must obviously be the act of sex that is referred to. ",
  "dn27:20.3": "khiyati = object to accuse, hardly “show anger” as per RD and MW. ",
  "dn27:20.6": "Note that the ehi formula is the same as original ordination. ",
  "dn27:21.1": "Upanibbatta is unknown elsewhere, and given that it is consistently used in different way than abhinibbatti, I would think there is some nuance of meaning distinguishing them. Clearly it doesn’t mean “first word” as they have been using language before. Mu Kd 17 here has saṁjñodapādi, “arisen by agreement”. I take the distinction to be that these terms were consciously invented and applied in this context, “closely” (upa-) or specifically for them. Comm has na kevalaṁ akkharameva, which may lend some support this idea. ",
  "dn27:22.3": "Read bāheti. ",
  "dn27:22.6": "Comm has “Vītaṅgārāvītadhūmāti pacitvā khāditabbābhāvato vigatadhūmaṅgārā” See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/an-extremely-dense-four-words/6049 ",
