  "dn25:1.3": "The commentary describes _udumbarikā_  as _deviyā_, “Queen” or “Lady”, while DA 8 says she is a “brahmin lady”. ",
  "dn25:5.10": "orodheyyāmā is unclear. I follow comm: Orodheyyāmāti vinandheyyāma. Pūritaghaṭo hi ito cito ca parivattetvā na suvinandhanīyo hoti.

  "dn25:11.12": "As noted by MW, comm here says “adassayamānoti ettha a-kāro nipātamattaṁ, dassayamānoti attho”. But this seems odd. Tika says ‘‘Ādassayamāno’’ti vā pāṭho. Again, this seems odd. If the first explanation is good, why need another? And if it is a genuine reading, it does not seem to be attested. Further, ādassana doesn’t seem to be attested as a genuine Pali term. ",
