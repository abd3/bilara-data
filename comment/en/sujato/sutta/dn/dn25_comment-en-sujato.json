  "dn25:1.3": "The Buddha refers to the events of this sutta at [dn8:23.2](), but apart from that Nigrodha (“Banyan”) appears to be unknown. The commentary describes _udumbarikā_ (“Fig”) as _devī_ (“Queen”), while DA 8 says she is a “brahmin lady”. She too does not seem to appear elsewhere. ",
  "dn25:1.4": "Sandhāna (“Conciliation”) was recognized as an eminent lay follower at ([an6.120-139:1.14]()). ",
  "dn25:5.5": "“One-eyed cow” is _gokāṇā_. ",
  "dn25:5.10": "_Orodheyyāma_ normally means “enclose, trap” like ox in a pen ([an6.60:3.1]()), but here it is glossed in the commentary as _vinandheyyāma_ (“twist around”). ",
  "dn25:7.16": "“Higher mortification in disgust of sin” renders _adhijegucche_. The basic sense is “disgust”. The idea is that people are tainted with corruption, somewhat comparable to the notion of “original sin”, although due to their own actions in the past rather than ancestral legacy. In “disgust” at that sin, they practice forms of mortification (_tapas_) to burn out the corruption. As spiritual practices these are “higher” (_adhi_) because they aim at liberation. ",

  "dn25:11.12": "“Sneaks” is _attānaṁ adassayamāno_, literally, “not showing himself”. They like to hang about with lay folk, but hide the fact that they do so. ",
  "dn25:11.16": "Note that comm applies this to views “Kiñcidevāti kiñci vajjaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ vā”, but earlier in the sutta “idaṁ me khamati, idaṁ me nakkhamatī’ti.” is applied to preferences regarding food. ",
