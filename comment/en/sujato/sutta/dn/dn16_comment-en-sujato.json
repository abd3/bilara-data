  "dn16:1.1.3": "It seems that after the events of [dn2](), Ajātasattu was able to retain and consolidate his power. In the decades following the Buddha’s passing, we know that Magadha did indeed swallow up the Vajjian Republic, and continued to expand until almost all of India was under its sway. An important part of this process was the consolidation of shipping routes on the Ganges, which was essential for establishing international trade. ",
  "dn16:1.1.5": "According to the commentary, Ajātasattu’s anger was rooted in a dispute on trade routes. There was a port on the Ganges extending over a league, split half and half between Magadha and Vajjī. Valuable products were sourced from a mountain and brought down for trade, but the Vajjans kept absconding with the whole lot. The place is not identified, but is probably Munger, a strategic port east of Patna. The nearby hills have been mined since paleolithic times. ",
  "dn16:1.2.1": "Vassakāra appears a number of times in the suttas as a devoted follower of the Buddha. ",
  "dn16:1.2.7": "The Vajjian Republic harks back to an early settlement founded by Nābhānediṣṭha in the Vedic period. It built its wealth on its extensive fertile plains suitable for agriculture, and the trading possibilities opened up by the Gandak and Ganges rivers. ",
  "dn16:1.2.9": "While it may seem strange to consult the Buddha on such a violent plan, Ajātasattu knows from his experience in DN 2 that the Buddha will not hesitate to tell him the truth, even if it is bad news for Ajātasattu. It seems he is trying to avoid the downfall of tyrants who are surrounded only with yes men. ",
  "dn16:1.3.1": "Reading _yojapetvā_ (“had them harnessed”), which is found in the Mahāsaṅgīti in similar passages, and here in the PTS. ",
  "dn16:1.4.1": "Ānanda is introduced here caring for the Buddha in his old age. He is the most prominent secondary character throughout this discourse, taking a far more prominent role than a simple interlocuter; he has a special personal relationship with the Buddha. Now, shortly after these events, he was entrusted with the task of reciting the suttas. It seems likely, then, that the first form of this discourse was composed by Ānanda in the years following his Master’s death. This lends a special poignancy to his scenes, as they are imbued with his own emotional struggle to deal with the Buddha’s passing. ",
  "dn16:1.4.3": "As for example at [an8.12:1.2](). ",
  "dn16:1.4.6": "Harmony is especially important as the Vajjian Republic was comprised of several different clans, among them the Licchavīs of Vesālī, the Mallas of Pāvā and Kusinārā, the Jñātṛkas north of Vesālī, the Uggas of Hatthigāma, and the Bhogas of Bhoganagara. The Videhans of Mithilā are sometimes included, but several sources indicate that they remained an independent, if reduced, kingdom until they were conquered by Magadha some years later. ",
  "dn16:1.4.9": "The “ancient Vajjian traditions” (_porāṇe vajjidhamme_) would have been established with the founding of the Vajjian republic some centuries earlier, which ensured that the members of the federation would have a voice in the Licchavi-dominated union. Compare with the “ancient traditions of the brahmins” (_porāṇā brāhmaṇadhammā_ at [an5.191]() and [snp2.7]()), the falling away from which is said to be the cause of Brahmanical decline. Similarly, the Buddha elsewhere scolds the Vajjians for their indulgence ([an5.143]()), suggesting that the decline may have already set in. ",
  "dn16:1.4.12": "Respect for elders is a common theme in the suttas. ",
  "dn16:1.4.15": "This advocates for legal protection for women from sexual violence. ",
  "dn16:1.4.18": "The Buddha will stay at several of these shrines later in this discourse. They were sacred groves, maintained by the people in reverence for the powerful spirits of nature. “Spirit-offerings” is _bali_. The commentary explains “inner or outer” as inside or outside the town. ",
  "dn16:1.4.21": "It is an old Indian belief that the presence of holy persons provides a kind of umbrella effect that protects the realm. ",
  "dn16:1.5.2": "This event is recorded at [an7.21](), where the Buddha addresses the Licchavis. The Sārandada shrine was short walk from Vesālī ([an5.143]()). ",
  "dn16:1.5.3": "There is a certain tension here: the Buddha taught these principles to the Vajjis, one of which is that the Vajjis should not adopt new decrees. It seems that a “decree” (_paññatta_) is more like constitutional law, whereas a “principle” (_dhamma_) is more like a behavioral guideline. ",
  "dn16:1.5.8": "_Upalāpana_ is used a number of times in the Vinaya, where it always has the sense of giving someone something to get them to do something you want. It has the same sense at [sn3.25:4.13](), where an enemy king may be bribed with gold from the royal treasury. ",
  "dn16:1.6.2": "There were several monasteries and hermitages in the hills around Rājagaha, from where monks would assemble for the fortnightly _uposatha_ (Kd 2:11.1.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#11.1.1). ",

  "dn16:1.25.4": "Brahmali: Suññāgāra normally means an empty dwelling, but here the context suggests another meaning is intended.

But they prepared a bed to one side right there, having surrounded it with a curtain, thinking, ‘The Teacher will rest here’.” ",
  "dn16:1.26.1": "Note that _nagara_ here, as often, means “citadel, fortress”, not “city”. It has the same sense as _pura_. ",
  "dn16:1.28.7": "Comm. is surely correct here: putabhedana refers to the breaking of packages, i.e. a trade center. ",
  "dn16:1.31.13": "I think it’s unlikely bhadrani means “auspcious'. Most commonly it” s used to describe chariots. And the similar line at AN 4.67 is applied to animals. ",

  "dn16:2.16.1": "There are various reading for pativattesi. I quite like that reading “forced them back”. Anandajoti has “rolled alongside” evidently reading parivattesi. Comm, however, has “Parivaṭṭesīti pahari”. ",
  "dn16:2.16.3": "I don’t know if it’s possible to be very literal, but i think it’s important to preserve something of the flavor of the insulting vocative je here, otherwise used of the “bad girl” Kali in MN 21. ",
  "dn16:2.18.8": "Despite the context, _ambakā_ has no etymological relation to _amba_ (“mango”) but is a term for “woman, mother” apparently used here as a play on words. ",

  "dn16:4.35.4": "I think the use of verbs for the garments is corrupt through this passage. Skt uses acchadeti throughout. Here upanameti means “brings close” cf Pj1. Below, it means “place on his body”, cf. SN 10.3 ",

But the usage here seems to be driven by grammar. Earlier avuso was used, but as an indeclinable it doesn’t work in instrumental, so apparently ayasmata is the fallback instrumental form; they are both from the same root.

Walshe more poetically has “To roam the realm of wisdom’s law”. Neither of these agree with comm, which has “Padesavattīti padese vipassanāmagge pavattanto”. However the Sanskrit has āryasya dharmasya pradeśavaktā, where vaktā means “speaker” and pradeśa presumably has the sense “pointing out”. Thus, “I have been the teacher who points out the noble teaching.” While disagreeing in details, this agrees with the thrust of the comm, in that it is to do with teaching. BTW, note that the Skt text has complete verses here and is far more satisfactory. It looks like the Pali has suffered loss of a couple of padas. ",
  "dn16:6.1.5": "It’s tempting to read pannatta here as “laid down”, as per Anandajoti, but see eg DN 9 “‘Sassato loko’ti kho, poṭṭhapāda, mayā anekaṁsiko dhammo desito paññatto;” ",

It seems, therefore, unlikely that the brahmadanda involved actually refusing to speak to him. Normally I render ovada as “advice” or “instructions”, which is also what I use for vattabba in this context, so I just have two terms in the translation. ",
