  "dn26:1.2": "_Mātulā_ means “maternal uncle”. This Magadhan village is mentioned only here. ",
  "dn26:1.7": "As at [dn16:2.26.1](). ",
  "dn26:1.14": "Two parables on mindfulness expand this idea ([sn47.6](), [sn46.7]()). ",
  "dn26:1.16": "_Evamidaṁ_ indicates entailment, as at [sn56.21:1.3](), [mn73:13.2](), [dn16:4.2.4](). ",
  "dn26:2.1": "We have heard the story of the wheel-turning monarch Mahāsudassana in [dn17](). Daḷhanemi appears only here. His name means “Strong-rim”, such being one of the characteristics of the Wheel. ",
  "dn26:3.2": "“Receded back” (_osakkitaṁ_): like a woman shrinking away from a man’s unwanted advances ([dn12:16.12]()). ",
  "dn26:3.13": "The signs of the renunciate predate Buddhism. ",
  "dn26:4.7": "“Inherited from your father” (_pettikaṁ dāyajjaṁ_) calls back to the four _satipaṭṭhānas_ that for a mendicant are “the domain of your fathers” (_pettike visaye_). In both cases they are to be earned, not conferred by lineage. ",
  "dn26:4.8": "“The noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch” (_ariye cakkavattivatte_; this is locative singular). I assume _ariya_ (“noble”) qualifies “duty” (_vatta_), as it does in the title below, _cakkavattiariyavatta_, rather than “monarch”. Normally _ariya_ is reserved for those who have attained the Buddhist path, but here we might have a rare use of _ariya_ in reference to Indo-Aryan (Vedic) culture. Compare the use of _ariyaka_ for speakers of Indo-Aryan languages at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.4.10](). However, the commentary says it simply means “flawless” (_niddoso_). ",
  "dn26:5.2": "_Saṁvidahassu_ is second middle imperative. ",
  "dn26:5.3": "_Pavattittha_ is aorist middle. _(A)dhammakāra_ (“injustice”) doesn’t seem to occur elsewhere in early Pali. It is found in Ja 513 and Ja 498, both times in the context of just rule. ",
  "dn26:5.4": "“Provide” (_anuppadeti_) is used elsewhere in the sense of paying back a loan ([an3.20:3.5]()), serving honored guests ([sn7.2:2.6]()), paying wages ([dn31:32.2]()), or a king supplying provisions for essential workers to do their job ([dn5:11.8.]()). It is thus more about fulfilling a moral obligation of fairness rather than offering charity. ",
  "dn26:5.5": "Where the phrase “from time to time go to them” (_te kālena kālaṁ upasaṅkamitvā_) occurs elsewhere in the suttas, it is always followed by “ask and question” (_paripucchati paripañhati_). Here, however, the second verb is “you should learn” (_pariggaṇheyyāsi_). ",
  "dn26:7.16": "“At the High Court” (_atthakaraṇapamukhe_) is uncertain. _Attha-_ has many variants, including _aḍḍa- and _aṭṭa-_. _Atthakaraṇa_ normally refers to a king “sitting in judgement” as at [sn3.7:1.5]() or [mn89:13.3](). Here, however it is a place. _-Pamukha_ is a standard descriptor of the attributes of a wheel-turning monarch in the sense of “finest” (eg. [dn17:2.5.1]()) rather than “entrance”. Thus I take it as meaning “the supreme place of judgement” i.e. “High Court”. ",
  "dn26:9.6": "I don’t know what pabbanti means, but comm sensibly has “na pabbantīti na vaḍḍhanti”. Note janapada in plural; extrapolating from the contemporary situation, it seems that the realm of the cakkavatti was comprised of several smaller nations. Both RD and MW mistranslate as “people” here. ",
  "dn26:9.7": "For anīkaṭṭhā, RD and MW both have “guards”. However comm says “Anīkaṭṭhāti hatthiācariyādayo”, which for some reason CPD thinks is worthy of an exclamation point. But surely this is reasonable: those in charge of the elephants and so on would have been important officials in the army. I think it is standing officers in the army, rather than royal guards as such. For mantassājīvino, RD and MW think it means chanters of mantras, but comm has “Mantassājīvinoti mantā vuccati paññā, taṁ nissayaṁ katvā ye jīvanti paṇḍitā mahāmattā, tesaṁ etaṁ nāmaṁ.” ",
  "dn26:19.5": "Horner has “rye” for kudrūsaka, but rye is a European grain. Finger millet is a widespread secondary grain in India, which grows in places rice cannot. While in Sri Lanka I learned that it is grown in the South, where it is too hot and dry for rice. But with the influence of climate change, rice will soon be unviable and finger millet, or kurukkan, will become essential. When I learned of this I was immediately reminded of this passage. I have no idea whether the word kurukkan is related to kudrusaka, but some of the other Indic terms for this grain seem to be, eg. the Pahari term “kodra”, Garhwal “koda”. ",
  "dn26:19.8": "Comm has “Atibyādippissantīti ativiya dippissanti, ayameva vā pāṭho” so its mainline version must have been Atibyādippissanti or similar. But this leaves unexplained the long ā in the sandhi. At the same time, the sense of dippati is not entirely clear here. RD has “flourish”, MW has “prevail”, but neither of these is really what it means. If anything, its basic meaning of “appear, show” contrasts more directly with antaradhayati. However, note that ādippati occurs, I think, once elsewhere in the canon, in AN 7.66, which by coincidence or not, also concerns a myth of the future. There it refers to an erupting volcano. Given that this explains the long ā, and that the unusual and emphatic form suggests a powerful meaning, I suggest that the sense “explode” (in popularity, etc.) fits here. ",
  "dn26:20.1": "See AN 2.9. ",
  "dn26:20.2": "For sambheda, see AN 2.9=DN 26, AN 5.103 = AN 10.45, and DN 3. In each case the sense is not “breaking, destroying” as you might expect, but the dissolving of boundaries, resulting in promiscuity or leaking of secrets. Comm. to DN 26 has “Sambhedanti missībhāvaṁ, mariyādabhedaṁ vā.” ",
  "dn26:21.8": "According to Cone (gāyati), sabhāgāyissanti is correct and PTS sabhā gāyissanti incorrect. Sabhāgāyissanti = sabhāga + āyissanti = will come together. samassāsissanti = sama + sāsati is absent from some manuscripts and is not commented on; I think it’s dubious. ",
  "dn26:21.9": "_Diṭṭhā_ is Sanskrit _diṣṭyā_), “fantastic, how fortunate”, per [dn16:2.24.5]() and [ja81:1.4](). The plural for sattā is puzzling; one var in PTS edition has the second as satta = voc sing, which I take as correct. Otherwise we would expect bhonto sattā, but this disagrees with the verb. ",
  "dn26:25.6": "Interesting choice of verb here: pariharati is not lead or command, but nurture, like a mother the child in her womb. ",
  "dn26:26.1": "This oddity is found in Bhaddaji’s verses at Thag 2.22 and the full story at Ja 264. While the Comm. stories, followed by RD and MW, say this is a palace, the verses there clearly depict a sacrificial post, yūpa. Probably the original meaning of this reference was lost early on, and the story filled in. "
