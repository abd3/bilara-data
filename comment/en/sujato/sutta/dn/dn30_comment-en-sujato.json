  "dn30:1.1.7": "This is one of the latest suttas in the Pali Nikāyas. Typically this topic only comes up in relation to the Buddha’s fulfillment of Brahmanical prophecies. Here it is developed with a series of ornate verses, none of which have parallels. Nonetheless, nowhere in the extensive discussions of the Buddha’s past good deeds is there any mention of the _pāramīs_ (“perfections”) or the Bodhisatta path. ",
  "dn30:1.2.1": "The marks are elsewhere listed in [dn14:1.32.7]() and [mn91:9.1](). ",
  "dn30:1.3.5": "The later astrological texts such as the Gārgīyajyotiṣa and Bṛhatsaṃhitāthat that discuss similar marks are more concerned with how they indicate character and destiny than their moral causes. ",
  "dn30:1.4.1": "The key terms here are _daḷha_ (“firm”) and _avatthita_ (“persistently”), which result in his firm stance. ",
  "dn30:1.6.2": "K.R. Norman’s series of five articles on *The Metres of the Lakkhaṇa-suttanta* discusses the verses in detail, and my translation is indebted to him. He notes that the 20 verse passages employ no less than seven distinct metres, all of them either new or updated styles. ",
  "dn30:1.6.20": "The commentary confirms the Mahāsaṅgīti reading _khambhana_ (“obtsacle”) here rather than PTS _gabbha_ (‘womb”). ",
  "dn30:1.7.1": "",
  "dn30:1.7.2": "The key term is “conveyed happiness” (_sukhāvaho_), like a wheeled cart would convey goods. _Parivāra_ means “surroundings, accompaniments”, and I follow the commentary, which takes it in the sense of the “trimmings” accompanying the food. Given, however, that the kammic result is a large _parivāra_ (“following”), it might mean that he gave not just physical things, but was generous with his followers also, engaging them in such beneficial tasks. ",
  "dn30:1.7.5": "",
  "dn30:1.9.2": "",
  "dn30:1.9.12": "This refers to the late legend of the soothsayers seeing the baby Siddhattha, and as such _kumāra_ should be taken as “prince”. ",
  "dn30:1.9.22": "",
  "dn30:1.10.5": "Giving up killing results in long life. This seems to be applied by metaphor to having these long and elegant body parts. ",
  "dn30:1.12.14": "This verse spoken by the soothsayers. ",
  "dn30:1.13.2": "He receives bodily fullness as a result of giving food. ",
  "dn30:1.16.6": "“Tender” because he treated people tenderly; “serried” because his fingers and toes are kept gracefully together, not splayed and separated. ",
  "dn30:1.17.3": "“Inclusive and well-managed” renders _saṅgahita_. It means “included”, as in those people who, due to the kindly actions, feel that they belong. For the sense “well-managed” see [an8.49:2.3](). Because of acting kindly and inclusively, people are well-disposed and work well together. ",
  "dn30:1.18.11": "Even though the community is geographically dispersed, it is still coherent. ",
  "dn30:1.18.13": "",
  "dn30:1.19.5": "Perhaps the uprightness of these marks relates to his speech being beneficial, leading upwards. ",

  "dn30:1.31.6": "The penis is the generative organ and hence part-creator of family. Being covered suggests that his sexuality was moderated and contained. His role was more than having children, it was building family. ",
  "dn30:2.1.6": "The banyan tree is not just proportioned, it offers shelter to many creatures. Touching the knees indicates connecting with the manyfolk, who at [an5.196:3.1]() are likened to caterpillars reaching the knees. ",
  "dn30:2.4.1": "",
  "dn30:2.4.2": "In Buddhism, _yogakkhema_ (“sanctuary”) usually means _nibbāna_, but here we see its earlier sense of a place of safety and refuge. ",

It’s possible that, as per RD, and partly MW, this refers to physical characteristics of the land, but in this instance I think comm is more plausible. We don’t expect a king to eliminate all rough terrain, but we do expect him to quell banditry. "
