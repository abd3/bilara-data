  "dn18:1.2": "This picks up from the events of [dn16:2.5.1](), which however discusses only the Ñātikans (who are reckoned among the Vajjis). Like [dn17](), it bears many signs of a late sutta. The overall theme is gradually revealed to be the presence of a cosmic order where the liberating teaching of the Buddha is reconciled with the requirements of the exercise of worldly power. ",
  "dn18:1.3": "This list of ten nations is unique. The omission of the Aṅgas and Magadhans is noted below. The more famous list of “sixteen nations” adds Avanti and Assaka in the south, and Gandhāra and Kamboja in the north-west (eg. [an3.70:28.3]()). The Buddha did not visit these lands, which explains why they are omitted. ",
  "dn18:1.5": "“Devotees” is _paricāraka_, which normally means “servant”. It is not in the relevant passages of DN 16. This sense is found  in only a couple of other places, both late ([snp5.18:1.2](), [pli-tv-kd1:22.14.8]()). ",
  "dn18:4.7": "As we known from [dn2](), Bimbisāra had recently been murdered by Ajātasattu. ",
  "dn18:4.9": "A not-so-subtle hint of the changes under Ajātasattu. The passing of Bimbisāra signifies the crumbling of the social order that prevailed in the Buddha’s lifetime, bringing with it the immediate threat of war and chaos. This sutta establishes a timeless order that remains while worldly conditions alter. ",
  "dn18:4.12": "Elsewhere the suttas say that Bimbisāra went for refuge ([dn4:6.33]()), while the Vinaya says he was in fact a stream-enterer ([pli-tv-kd1:22.9.1]()), which is confirmed below. The Jains, however, claim him as one of their own but say he went to hell for committing suicide. Like his son Ajātasattu, it is likely that he frequented several teachers in his realm. ",

  "dn18:6.10": "“Suggestion” is _parikathaṁ_, which elsewhere occurs in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-kd7:1.5.16]()) and the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga ([vb17:43.2]()) in the sense of “hint”. ",

  "dn18:20.3": "The sutta began by recounting those who have achieved various stages of awakening. By setting them on a course to freedom from all rebirths, this could be seen as threatening the gods, who rely on numbers to prevail in their battles with the demons. Brahmā is preempting such arguments by pointing out that many of the Buddha’s followers are reborn among the gods without escaping transmigration, at least not for now. This is no trivial metaphysical argument. In order for Buddhism to prevail, it must show that its radical soteriology is compatible with worldly prosperity, or else it would face determined opposition from kings and other temporal powers. The gods act as proxies to demonstrate the appropriate behavior for terrestrial kings. This is why the leading character is Bimbisāra/Janavasabha, who straddles the two realms. ",
  "dn18:22.3": "_Yāva supaññattā_ is also at [mn51:4.3](); it is a variation of the standard _yāvasubhāsita_. Here _taṁ kiṁ maññanti_ is used as a rhetorical device, not a genuine question.
