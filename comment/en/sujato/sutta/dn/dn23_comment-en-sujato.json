  "dn23:1.2": "Kumārakassapa was ordained at twenty ([pli-tv-kd1:75.1.1]()). He features in the Vammikasutta ([mn23]()), and his verses are collected in the Theragāthā ([thag2.41]()). He was declared the foremost of those with brilliant speech, apparently on the basis of this discourse. When a sutta begins without mentioning the Buddha, however, it usually means it was spoken after the Buddha’s passing, a detail confirmed by the commentary to Vimānavatthu 74. The Pāyāsisuta is the only major Buddhist text that has a Jain parallel, Paesi-kahāṇayaṁ, a similar dialogue between Paesi and Keśin in Setavyā. ",
  "dn23:1.3": "Setavyā was north-east of Sāvatthī. ",
  "dn23:1.4": "Pāyāsi  was a _khattiya_ yet he receives a _brahmadeyya_. The sense of _brahmadeyya_ as a donation to brahmins is well attested in inscriptions, so I think this is likely a mistake in the text, rather than evidence that the practice was not for brahmins only. ",
  "dn23:2.2": "This is wrong view per [mn117:5.1](). ",
  "dn23:5.4": "This idiom recurs at [an6.38:1.5]() where, as here, it refers to a well-known view and cannot mean that they have never heard of it. There the text and commentary read _māhaṁ_, which with the aorist is prohibitive not negatory. It is an idiom expressing dislike. ",
  "dn23:5.11": "While the world “down here” is bogged down in its messy and ephemeral issues, the heavenly bodies proceed in their serene, glorious, stately indifference. Ignoring gravity, self-luminous, and apparently eternal, they operate according to what appears to be an entirely different set of rules, a “meta-physics”. What Newton did in physics the Buddha did in spirituality: show that the heavens, despite appearances, operate with the same set of conditioned rules as apply down here. ",
  "dn23:5.12": "Kassapa’s argument here doesn’t directly establish his conclusion. It is possible that gods exist on an entirely separate plane that has nothing to do with kamma and rebirth. ",
  "dn23:6.1": "",
  "dn23:6.18": "This is still a major factor in shaping belief. People will reject the opinions of experts and believe people that they know. ",
  "dn23:7.8": "",
  "dn23:7.10": "Follow PTS reading _uddassetvā_, which at [mn82:11.9]() has the sense “visit”. ",
  "dn23:7.19": "Kassapa, however, has not established the existence of an afterlife, he has merely refuted Pāyāsi’s argument. ",
  "dn23:9.31": "Follow PTS reading _ubbāhati_. Cf. [an3.93:6.4]() for the sense “transport”. ",
  "dn23:11.2": "36,000,000 years. ",
  "dn23:11.10": "This recognizes the relativity of time. ",
  "dn23:11.13": "Pāyāsi makes a good point; he only relies on sources that he knows he can trust. ",
  "dn23:11.41": "Kassapa establishes the empirical method by which these truths are known. Science extends knowledge by means of external instruments, while meditation extends the scope of consciousness. A non-scientist cannot understand how a scientist establishes their conclusions, and can only rely on trust in the scientific establishment. Likewise a non-meditator cannot understand the capacity of expanded consciousness. ",
  "dn23:13.9": "",
  "dn23:13.13": "The commentary explains _opabhoggā_ (“reward”) as _pādaparicārikā_ (“wife”). ",
  "dn23:13.26": "Read _opāṭesi_. ",
  "dn23:13.27": "Prefer Mahāsaṅgīti reading over PTS _yāva jānāmi_ (“until I know”); it echoes _yāva vijāyāmi_ above. The phrase is not fully coherent, which is understandable given the circumstances. ",
  "dn23:14.10": "",
  "dn23:18.12": "Āmato hotīti addhamato marituṁ āraddho hoti ",
  "dn23:18.29": "Cp. AN 9.37, where this is more aptly describing a deep meditation. AS MW notes, this seems arbitrary here. ",
  "dn23:21.52": "Note that verb tenses in this passage very in editions: I translate according to the sense. ",

  "dn23:27.6": "Comm says “Pajjohissāmīti pajjohanaṁ karissāmi, balikammaṁ karissāmīti attho”, which is followed by RD and MW. Tika says “Pajjohananti pakārehi juhanakammaṁ. Taṁ pana balidānavasena karīyatīti āha ‘‘balikamma’’nti.” DA 7, instead, simply has 今日且停，明當更共試. ",
  "dn23:29.7": "Comm: “Gāmapaṭṭanti vuṭṭhitagāmapadeso vuccati. ‘‘Gāmapada’’ntipi pāṭho, ayamevattho” ",
  "dn23:29.13": "The sunk cost fallacy! ",
  "dn23:32.2": "Read dhorakani, from dhura (comm thūlāni). For guḷavālakāni, cp. Kd 15 which has macchavāḷaka for a monk’s (forbidden) robe. It doesn’t make it particularly clear, but at least it’s something. ",
