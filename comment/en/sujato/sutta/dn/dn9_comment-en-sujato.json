  "dn9:1.3": "Mallikā was the chief queen of Pasenadi, and her place is mentioned in a similar context at [mn78:1.3](). The commentary explains that the brahmins, Jains, and others would assemble there to “debate their beliefs” (_samayaṁ pavadanti_). Evidently the monastery grounds had accommodation for many ascetics of different beliefs, but only “one hall” where they would gather for debate. We hear many times of such debates, but here we catch a glimpse of a place that was set up to facilitate them. For _-ācīra_, read in the sense of “boundary, hedge” (Commentary: _timbarūrukkhapantiyā parikkhittattā_; cf. Sanskrit _prācīra_, “enclosure, hedge, fence, wall”). ",
  "dn9:2.2": "This happened a number of times, but nowhere, to my knowledge, is it explained why the Buddha kept getting the time for alms-round wrong. ",
  "dn9:2.3": "This can be understood as answering the criticism voiced in [dn8:22.2](), that Buddha was afraid to speak in an assembly. ",
  "dn9:3.1": "In contrast with the silence of the Buddha’s community at [dn2:10.7](). ",
  "dn9:4.6": "The Buddha encourages quiet for the sake of mental development; Poṭṭhapāda does it for the sake of reputation. ",
  "dn9:5.3": "Poṭṭhapāda’s address is almost overly deferential. ",
  "dn9:5.10": "Always polite, the Buddha begins by showing an interest in them. ",
  "dn9:6.2": "Poṭṭhapāda deflects. ",
  "dn9:6.4": "_Abhisaññā_ does not appear elsewhere. Here the prefix _abhi-_ means not “higher”, but rather “about, concerning”. Compare the early use of _abhidhamma_ and _abhivinaya_, for example at [mn32:8.6](): _dve bhikkhū abhidhammakathaṁ kathenti_ (“two mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching”). ",
  "dn9:6.5": "",
  "dn9:6.7": "Here perception is not identified with the “person” (_purisa_), but rather belongs to them (cf. _etaṁ mama_, “this is mine”). ",
  "dn9:6.12": "This idiom is also at [sn47.19:1.10](). ",
  "dn9:6.13": "The self is defined as perception (_eso me attā_), one of the five aggregates. Compare the various theories of the self and perception at [dn1:2.38.0](). ",
  "dn9:6.16": "Implying that at such times a person lacks a “self”. This is perhaps related to the Upanishadic theories of what happens to the self when asleep and dreaming. ",
  "dn9:6.21": "See [dn29:16.20]() for _upakaḍḍhati_ and _apakaḍḍhati_ in this sense. ",
  "dn9:6.34": "_Pakataññū_ is not elsewhere attested in the suttas, but it is found in the Vinaya, for example at [Bu Pc 72:1.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc72/en/brahmali#1.8). ",
  "dn9:7.5": "Here the Buddha argues that, since it is possible to change the nature of one’s own mind through practice, such changes cannot be random. ",
  "dn9:7.6": "It is is unusual if not unique to add “said the Buddha” (_bhagavā avoca_) in such a context. Normally, once a speaker starts, the text does not insert extra tags identifying the speaker without a reason, such as an interruption for a question. ",
  "dn9:9-10.2": "Progress through the _jhānas_ is explained in terms of the refining of perceptions. ",
  "dn9:9-10.3": "“Subtle and true” is _sukhumasacca_, a term that appears only here. ",
  "dn9:11.5": "",
  "dn9:14.1": "We have encountered the “formless attainments” (_arūpasamāpatti_) before, where they formed a subtle basis for attachment to self ([dn1:3.13.4]()). Here they appear as part of the gradual refinement of consciousness through the cessation of increasingly subtle perceptions. ",
  "dn9:14.2": "This is the vision of light that later came to be called a “sign” (_nimitta_). In the first four _jhānas_ this persists as a “subtle” (_sukhuma_) reflection or echo of the “substantial” (_olārika_) material basis of meditation, such as the breath or the parts of the body. Even though it is a purely mental phenomenon, it is still “form” (_rūpa_) since it has physical properties like light or extension. ",
  "dn9:14.3": "The “light” (_obhāsa_) of _jhāna_ grows from “limited” (_paritta_) to “limitless” (_appamāṇa_, [mn128:29.1]()). Then the perception of even this limitless light vanishes, leaving only infinite space. ",
  "dn9:15.1": "Perception of infinite space fades away leaving only the infinite consciousness that is aware. ",
  "dn9:16.1": "The meditator is no longer even aware of infinite consciousness, but of the even vaster nothingness. ",
  "dn9:16.4": "The last of the four formless attainments is the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Since this, by definition, lies beyond the scope of perception, it is not included here. ",
  "dn9:17.1": "For _sakasaññī_ (“takes charge of their own perception”), see [Bu Pj 2:6.2.2](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:6.2.2). One relevant factor in determining whether an object has been stolen is if the accused “perceives it as their own”. Here it means that the meditator understands that they can evolve their own perceptions through meditation. ",
  "dn9:17.4": "“Intend and choose” is _ceteyyaṁ abhisaṅkhareyyaṁ_ (1st singular optative). These synonyms are used in the sense of a subtle sense of will or intentionality that underlies such attainments ([mn52:14.3]) and which must be let go lest they generate rebirth ([mn140:22.10]()). ",
  "dn9:17.9": "Compare with “progressive cessation” ([an9.31]()), “progressive tranquilizing of conditions” ([sn36.15]()), “progressive meditations” ([an9.32]()), etc. “Awareness” is _sampajāna_, which we have encountered previously as “situational awareness” in daily activities, or as the “awareness” in the third _jhāna_. Here it refers to a reflective capacity to understand the nature of deep meditation in terms of causality. ",
  "dn9:18.4": "Poṭṭhapāda shows the Buddha that he has been paying attention. Notice how it is culturally assumed that it is possible to retain and repeat the exact content of the teaching. ",
  "dn9:19.4": "The meaning of this is not clear to me. It might mean that insight can be developed based on any of the stages of meditation, so for that person their peak of perception is different to another’s. The commentary says that it refers to different meditation subjects, or simply to different occasions of meditation. ",
  "dn9:20.2": "Perception has been described in terms of the progress through more refined meditations (_samādhi_). Only then does the “knowledge” (_ñāṇa_) of insight arise. ",
  "dn9:20.4": "The term “specific condition” (_idappaccayā_) is well known from the context of dependent origination (eg, [sn12.20:2.3]()), where it applies to the general situation of ongoing existence in transmigration. When developing insight, a meditator takes their own meditation experience as their primary locus. This is then generalized to an understanding of the nature of conscious existence. ",
  "dn9:21.1": "This draws from the initial presentation of different theories of the person and perception ([dn9:6.4]()). ",
  "dn9:21.2": "“Believe” is _paccesi_, literally “go back to”. It implies that an idea is something one relies on or takes as fundamental. The Buddha wants to know where Poṭṭhapāda stands before exploring this topic. ",
  "dn9:21.3": "Despite his previous questions about perception and the self, Poṭṭhapāda takes his stand on a purely materialist view, identifying the “self” with the organic “substantial” body. ",
  "dn9:21.4": "Again, the Buddha does not rush to tell Poṭṭhapāda he is right or wrong, but rather draws out the implications of his statement. ",
  "dn9:21.6": "Here _tiṭṭhateva_ is not “leaving aside”, but “remains”. Compare the similar construction at [mn107:13.1](). ",
  "dn9:22.1": "This is the “subtle” (_sukhuma_) body, corresponding with the form experienced in the four jhānas. All manuscripts appear to be missing the expected _rūpī_ in this passage, but it occurs in the corresponding passage on the _attapaṭilābha_ below. ",
  "dn9:23.1": "This identifies the self as that which is experienced in the formless attainments. Poṭṭhapāda is simply cycling through possible self theories without really thinking through the implications. ",
  "dn9:24.1": "Poṭṭhapāda can only attest a belief in various theories and still does not know how to assess them for himself. ",
  "dn9:24.3": "The text shifts from _añña_ “other” (eg. _aññadiṭṭhikena_) to _aññatra_ (_aññatr’āyogena_), which normally means “apart from”. Most authorities follow the commentary in taking _aññatra_ here in the sense of “other”. However I think the change of sense is deliberate; the Buddha is not discouraging them, merely informing them what it will take. ",
  "dn9:25.3": "This is the famous list of ten “undeclared points”, which are found throughout the suttas. They seem to have functioned as a kind of checklist by which philosophers could be evaluated and classified. The word _loka_ occurs in a number of senses, but here it refers to the entire “cosmos” of countless worlds. ",
  "dn9:31.1": "This phrase recurs at [sn21.9:1.4]() and [an3.64:11.1](), with some variant readings. ",
  "dn9:32.1": "The commentary says Citta was the son of an elephant trainer. here he shows greater respect to the Buddha than Poṭṭhapāda. ",
  "dn9:33.3": "This point seems to be lost on a number of modern commentators, who infer from passages such as the ten undeclared points that the Buddha refused to make any definitive declarations at all. The Buddha, rather, was a _vibhajjavādin_ ([mn99:4.4](), [an10.94:4.7]()), “one who speaks after analysis”. ",
  "dn9:34.2": "See [dn1:2.38.2](). ",
  "dn9:34.4": "The Buddha does not rely on rumor; he begins by checking his facts with those concerned. Not only does this affirm his commitment to truth, it shows respect and establishes a common ground from which the argument proceeds. ",
  "dn9:34.8": "The verb _viharati_ means “dwell”, and functions as an auxiliary verb implying duration. In spiritual contexts it often means “a period or state of meditation”. This first question is asking whether they see such a state in a regular meditation practice. ",
  "dn9:34.11": "Perhaps they might not be able to develop a meditation for seeing that self, but at some point they may have had some sort of perception or vision or insight. ",
  "dn9:37.1": "nisseni only occurs elsewhere in Ss 6 and Ss 7 where it is something carried, i.e. a ladder. ",
  "dn9:39.1": "Comm: Tattha attapaṭilābhoti attabhāvapaṭilābho, ettha ca bhagavā tīhi attabhāvapaṭilābhehi tayo bhave dassesi ",
  "dn9:40.4": "I find the syntax of this passage perplexing. Compare the similar sentiment at SN 22.2, which has a much more clear syntax. ",
  "dn9:45.5": "This whole argument is odd, and I suspect it is corrupt. ",
  "dn9:56.4": "Not without some wavering, according to AN 6.60 "
