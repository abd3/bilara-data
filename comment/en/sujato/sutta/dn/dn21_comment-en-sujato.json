  "dn21:1.1.1": "This discourse is quoted by name and a passage discussed at [sn22.4](). A Sanskrit parallel published by Ernst Waldschmidt in 1979 is available on SuttaCentral as [SF 241](https://suttacentral.net/sf241/san/waldschmidt). A different discourse of the same name is found at [sn35.118](). ",
  "dn21:1.1.2": "Rhys Davids follows the commentary in translating this “the cave of Indra’s Sāl Tree”. However the Sanskrit  _yāvacchailaguhāyām_ supports “hill cave”. ",
  "dn21:1.2.1": "Introduced in a minor role in [dn18](), [dn19](), and [dn20](), Pañcasikha gets his moment to shine in this sutta. Outside of the Dīghanikāya, he appears only in [sn35.119](). His name means “Fivecrest”, evidently in reference to his impressive hairdo; a nymph or group of nymphs bore the synonymous name Pañcacūḍā, “Five Topknots”. The centaur (_gandhabba_) was a wild rogue of music, dancing, and sex. A purpose of this sutta, it would seem, is to tame his unbridled masculinity, analogous to how the warlike Indra becomes the pacifist Sakka. A less diplomatic approach is taken in Atharvaveda 4.37.7, where the _gandharva_ with his “crest” (_śikhaṇḍino_) is threatened with castration. ",
  "dn21:1.2.4": "The “arched harp” (_vīṇa_) was a multi-stringed instrument held in the lap, with the strings attached across a curved open arch or bow. It is not the modern Indian instrument called veena, which is a lute or stick zither. _Gandhabbas_ are closely associated with music. ",
  "dn21:1.2.5": "In the Buddhist hierarchy of divinity, _gandhabbas_ occupy a more humble place than the gods of the Thirty-Three, yet here Pañcasikha appears with them in a position of honor. In [dn19:28.3]() we saw that the even more exalted Brahmā takes the form of Pañcasikha. This fluidity is characteristic of old Vedic cosmology, where there is no clear hierarchy of divinity. The formalized Buddhist hierarchy is a later conception. ",
  "dn21:1.3.1": "",
  "dn21:1.4.2": "We will learn later of how Sakka’s appearance could be too disturbing for the Buddha while on retreat. Pañcasikha, on the other hand, would appear alone, without a retinue. ",
  "dn21:1.4.8": "From a Buddhist point of view, the idea that the Buddha would be wooed by a love song seems like an absurd conceit. But for Pañcasikha, it shows that the inveterate lecher is finally seeking a commitment in marriage. ",
  "dn21:1.5.1": "Suriyavaccasā (“Sunshine”) reflects the solar dimension of the _gandhabba_ mytheme. She appears in Atharvaveda 8.10.27, which invokes the _gandharvas_ with their female counterpart the “nymphs” (Pali _accharā_, Sanskrit _āpsarásā_). ",
  "dn21:1.5.2": "In Sanskrit literature, Timbaru (Sanskrit _tumburu_) was an elder _gandharva_ musician in the courts of Indra and Kuvera. According to Rāmāyaṇa 3.4, he was cursed with a monstrous form by Kuvera due to an inappropriate lust for the nymph Rambhā. Upon his defeat at the hands of Rāma he was restored to his former status. Pañcasikha would have wanted to avoid a similar fate. Rather than Suriyavaccasā, the Sanskrit literature mentions his daughters Manuvantī and Sukeśī (Vāyupurāṇa 69.49 =  Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 2.7.13). ",
  "dn21:1.5.7": "_Aṅgīrasi_ means “shining one” and is etymologically linked with _agni_ (“fire”). Suriyavaccasā earned the name due to both her radiant nature and her family connections: her father Timbaru was a son of Kaśyapa, who was (according to certain lineages) brother of Aṅgīras, from whom the Aṅgīrasas were descended. In the Arthavaveda—the only early non-Buddhist source for a nymph Suriyavaccasā—_aṅgīrasi_ is associated with witchcraft (Atharvaveda 12.5.52). _Aṅgīrasa_ is a patronymic of the Buddha ([dn32:3.14]()). ",
  "dn21:1.5.8": "“Saints” is _arahantā_, which I normally translated as “perfected ones”. ",
  "dn21:1.5.11": "_Parinibbāpaya_, “please quench me”. Pañcasikha subverts imagery employed by the Buddha—quenching thirst, cooling breezes, extinguished flames—to erotic effect. ",
  "dn21:1.5.17": "Pañcasikha is showing off his literary skill. The same image, the elephant, illustrates opposing qualities: both peaceful and violent. In these two sides of sensual desire, he reveals, unconsciously perhaps, the rapacious side of his own nature. ",
  "dn21:1.5.36": "For how a married couple may stay together in this life and the next, see [an4.55](). ",
  "dn21:1.5.43": "Pañcasikha is using the present participle _jigīsāno_ in the historical present. ",
  "dn21:1.5.49": "In later culture, a _gandharva_ wedding was a pure love-match, without the blessing of parents or priests. Here, however, Pañcasikha wants to do the right thing and get the father’s blessing. ",
  "dn21:1.6.7": "“Sister” (_bhaginī_) is a respectful term of address, but is normally used in a chaste sense. When Raṭṭhapāla calls his wives “sister”, they faint in shock ([mn82:23.4]()). ",
  "dn21:1.6.8": "Sikhaṇḍī (“egg-crested”) is the term for the centaur as seductive threat to women in Atharvaveda 4.37.7. It is also a poetic term for a peacock. ",
  "dn21:1.6.10": "",
  "dn21:1.7.14": "",
  "dn21:1.9.3": "It is rare for the Buddha to address a deity as “venerable” (_āyasmā_), a term usually reserved for monks. Moggallāna addresses Sakka as “the venerable Kosiya” at [mn37:10.6](); Mahākassapa calls him Kosiya without honorific at [ud3.7:3.12](). The word _kosiya_ is explained by the commentaries as “owl”, which, if correct, would have been the totem for a clan of that name. It is, however, a patronymic. Rig Veda 1.10.11 has _indra kauśika_ which means “Indra, son of Kuśika (or Kuśa)”. _Kuśa_ grass is critical to the performance of Vedic rites, and the label probably initially implied “Brahmanized”, i.e. a king whose reign was authorized according to Vedic ritual. ",
  "dn21:1.10.1": "A _paricārikā_ is a maid attending on a nymph ([mn37:8.12]()). Bhūjati (variant _bhuñjatī_) does not seem to appear elsewhere. ",
  "dn21:1.10.13": "Sakka pointedly ignores this, but perhaps his shame at disturbing the Buddha’s meditation explains his oblique method of gaining an audience. ",
  "dn21:1.11.5": "This implies she was a stream-enterer. ",
  "dn21:1.11.6": "In Buddhism, sex is mutable between lives and even within one life ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.6.1]()). While later Buddhists sometimes held that the status of a male was preferable, this is one of the few places in the early texts where this is implied, even if not stated outright. Notably, it is not the Buddha who says this, but Sakka, relaying the story of another deity. That the proponent of this idea was a woman, at least formerly, is a common trope of Indian literature: a woman is the ideal misogynist (see eg. [ja61]() or Śivapurāna chapter 4). ",
  "dn21:1.11.13": "kutomukha contrasts with sammukha. Comm: “kutomukhāti bhagavati abhimukhe dhammaṁ desente tumhe kutomukhā kiṁ aññā vihitā ito cito ca olokayamānā udāhu niddāyamānā?” Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, it means “who on earth taught you the dhamma?” ",
  "dn21:1.11.19": "It seems that the patilabhimsu must serve duty for the two phrases, an unusual construction in prose. Either that or a verb for rebirth has been omitted. Comm: 'Tattha diṭṭheva dhammeti tasmiññeva attabhāve jhānasatiṁ paṭilabhiṁsu. Tattheva ṭhatvā cutā pana kāyaṁ brahmapurohitaṁ brahmapurohitasarīraṁ paṭilabhiṁsūti evamattho daṭṭhabbo.' ",
  "dn21:1.12.57": "Both RD and MW seem to take janinda as vocative, ignoring jan’. But Sakka is devinda, not janinda; and comm says Janindanti sabbalokuttamaṁ ",
  "dn21:1.12.60": "end quote in MS is incorrect. ",
  "dn21:1.12.64": "The end point of Gopaka’s speech is hard to determine, as there is no close ti. MS places it on the previous verse, but this seems unlikely, as this verse is still telling the basic story. RD and MW place it after namassama below. But this seems unlikely, as Gopaka uses the singular referring to himself, where Sakka often uses the plural. Moreover, the logic flows better if we end it here. The next line refers to the “exposition of the teaching”, which must mean Gopaka’s teaching. Also, RD and MW’s idea that this is “The Truth may yet be realized” is wrong. ",
  "dn21:1.12.65": "The feminine etadisi is hard to explain. It occurs rarely, one occurrence being earlier in this sutta, where it applies to Suriyavacchasa. Here, however, Gopaka has already become a man; having labored this point, it seems odd to just ignore it. More likely dhammappakasanā is feminine. This use is fairly common in later texts (it occurs at the conclusion of the Tika for this sutta—Sakkapañhasuttavaṇṇanāya līnatthappakāsanā). Comm seems to want it to apply to both the disciple and the teaching: Etādisī dhammappakāsanetthāti ettha sāsane evarūpā dhammappakāsanā, yāya sāvakā etehi guṇehi samannāgatā honti. ",
  "dn21:2.3.10": "RD and MW both read this passage as applying to the Buddha, evidently taking jaññā to be absolutive. But cp. AN 9.6, where the identical idiom is used. There it cannot be the Buddha, so jaññā must be optative 3 singular. BB renders “If one knows of a person”. Note that I designed my rendering so as to enable breaking up the otherwise unwieldy sentence. ",
  "dn21:2.5.16": "Sakka switches from marisa to bhante here, and back to marisa below. This is probably a sign of sloppy editing. The whole passage is found at MN 114, where bhante is used, and this suggests it was imported from there. ",
  "dn21:2.6.2": "RD, MW, and Ṭhānissaro all take this as “same doctrine”, etc. This is probably right, but it is not a simple as it seems. Normally ekanta has the sense of “exclusively, solely”. That doesn’t make sense here, and the text may be corrupt. Skt at SF 241 has na haiva sarvasatvā ekakāmā ekacchandāḥ, which is more expected. Taken literally, ekanta could mean “of one aim”. This would then be a slightly different question: “(though we know that they appear different, nevertheless) is the end result of spiritual practice the same?” It seems comm has this in mind at least for the first term, but it is unclear to me whether it intended this analysis to be applied to each term: “Ekantavādāti ekoyeva anto vādassa etesaṁ, na dvedhā gatavādāti ekantavādā, ekaññeva vadantīti pucchati. Ekantasīlāti ekācārā. Ekantachandāti ekaladdhikā. Ekantaajjhosānāti ekantapariyosānā.” ",
  "dn21:2.8.5": "This is odd, and i am not sure what it means. MW says “The chance, by kamma, of another earthly life”, but there is no mention of chance, kamma, or earthly. Comm says: “Punarāyu ca me laddhoti puna aññena kammavipākena me jīvitaṁ laddhanti, iminā attano cutabhāvaṁ ceva upapannabhāvañca āvikaroti.” But what? Everyone gets reborn anyway, the point of Buddhism is to stop rebirth. Moreover, the nbext verse speaks of rebirth. Perhaps, rather, it simply means that the merit of Dhamma has extended his stay in his current fortunate birth. ",
  "dn21:2.8.21": "Comm: Sveva anto bhavissatīti so eva me manussaloke anto bhavissatīti. ",
  "dn21:2.9.32": "Sāmaṁ karomāti namakkāraṁ karoma "
