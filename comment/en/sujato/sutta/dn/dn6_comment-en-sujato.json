  "dn6:1.2": "Vesālī was the largest city in the Vajjian confederacy, an alliance of aristocratic republics. Lying some 60 kilometers north of Pāṭaliputra (Patna), it was dominated by the Licchavi clan. ",
  "dn6:1.3": "In the earlier suttas of this chapter, we have seen how news of the Buddha spread, evidently following Pokkharasāti’s conversion. Here we see an example of the kind of meeting at which such news would be discussed. The phrase “brahmin emissaries” _brāhmaṇadūtā_ does not seem to occur elsewhere and is not explained in the commentary. Perhaps they were emissaries of the kings, meeting in a neutral location. Or perhaps they were emissaries of their respective communities of brahmins. ",
  "dn6:1.5": "This monastery features prominently as the Buddha’s usual place of residence near Vesālī. ",
  "dn6:2.2": "For the latter half of the Buddha’s life, Ānanda was his attendant. This detail suggests that the events took place relatively early in the Buddha’s teaching career. ",
  "dn6:2.6": "At some times the Buddha would go on retreat and ask that no-one visit him except to bring food; this sometimes happened at the Great Wood ([sn54.9:2.1]()). He also had the habit of withdrawing into the wood itself for meditation ([an5.58:1.3]()). At this time, however, he was simply staying in a nearby hut, so it seems Nāgita is being over-zealous. ",
  "dn6:3.1": "Oṭṭhaddha mean “hare-lip” and is evidently a nickname or epithet. Throughout, the Buddha refers to him by his personal name, Mahāli. And it is under that name we meet him again in [sn11.13]() and [sn22.60](). ",
  "dn6:4.3": "In trying to protect the Buddha, Nāgita was inflexible and lacking compassion. When given good advice by Sīha, he responded gracelessly, fobbing off responsibility to a junior. No wonder he was replaced by Ānanda. ",
  "dn6:4.9": "This is still a common place for forest monks to receive guests. ",
  "dn6:5.3": "Sunakkhatta features in several suttas, through which his journey may be traced. In [mn105]() he meets the Buddha and gains faith; here in [dn6]() he is becoming dissatisfied; in [dn24]() he rejects the Buddha; and in [mn12]() he attacks the Buddha after disrobing. ",
  "dn6:5.4": "This refers to “clairvoyance” and “clairaudience”, sometimes translated as the “divine eye” and “divine ear”. Despite being included in the Gradual Training, they are not a goal of Buddhist practice. Rather, they are unnecessary but potentially useful, as they reveal dimensions of being inaccessible to ordinary consciousness. Sunakkhatta, however, was evidently just interested in having pleasant supersensory experiences. ",
  "dn6:5.7": "This must have wounded his pride. ",
  "dn6:6.2": "This description of meditation is unique in the Pali canon. The Buddha answers Mahāli’s question directly, even though the premise betrayed Sunakkhatta’s limited understanding. When a questioner is sincere, answering directly shows respect and builds trust. ",
  "dn6:12.2": "Having directly answered the original question, the Buddha reframed the issue on request. ",
  "dn6:15.3": "Contra MW, text does not say both were paribbajaka. Again, RD is more accurate. ",
  "dn6:16.9": "Take care of quote nesting: MS is wrong. "
