  "dn6:1.2": "Vesālī was the largest city in the Vajjian confederacy, an alliance of aristocratic republics. Lying some 60 kilometers north of Pāṭaliputra (Patna), it was dominated by the Licchavi clan. ",
  "dn6:1.3": "In the earlier suttas of this chapter, we have seen how news of the Buddha spread, evidently following Pokkharasāti’s conversion. Here we see an example of the kind of meeting at which such news would be discussed. The phrase “brahmin emissaries” _brāhmaṇadūtā_ does not seem to occur elsewhere and is not explained in the commentary. Perhaps they were emissaries of the kings, meeting in a neutral location. Or perhaps they were emissaries of their respective communities of brahmins. ",
  "dn6:1.5": "This monastery features prominently as the Buddha’s usual place of residence near Vesālī. ",
  "dn6:2.2": "For the latter half of the Buddha’s life, Ānanda was his attendant. This detail suggests that the events took place relatively early in the Buddha’s teaching career. ",
  "dn6:2.6": "At some times the Buddha would go on retreat and ask that no-one visit him except to bring food. This sometimes happened at the Great Wood ([sn54.9:2.1]()). He also had the habit of withdrawing into the wood itself for meditation ([an5.58:1.3]()). At this time, however, he was simply staying in a nearby hut, so it seems Nāgita is being over-zealous. ",
  "dn6:4.3": "This a textbook example of how not to do your job. Take orders too literally, being inflexible and uncompassionate. Then when given good advice, respond gracelessly, concerned only to avoid possible repercussions. so you fob it off on a junior, so they get any fallback, while you skirt responsibility. No wonder Nagita got replaced! ",
  "dn6:6.2": "RD’s translation of this passage is much more satisfactory than MW’s. ",
  "dn6:15.3": "Contra MW, text does not say both were paribbajaka. Again, RD is more accurate. ",
  "dn6:16.9": "Take care of quote nesting: MS is wrong. "
