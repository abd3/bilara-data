  "dn28:5.3": "The Bodhisatta is said elsewhere to be conceived in awareness (eg. [dn16:3.15.1]()), but this systematic analysis is found only here and at [dn33:1.11.176](). It seems like an abrupt shift from central Dhamma topics. ",

  "dn28:7.3": "Meditation is described in this way only in [mn136:9.1]() and [dn1:1.31.1]() where, as here, it is pursued by an “ascetic or brahmin”, who in those cases is not Buddhist. Here, however, it sounds like Sāriputta is talking about a Buddhist practice. The _asubha_ contemplation of the parts of the body is described in several places in the canon (eg.
