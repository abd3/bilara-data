  "dn28:1.2": "This discourse is expanded from the events of [dn16:1.16.1](). ",
  "dn28:2.12": "Here the additional material begins. While they are all said to be teachings of the Buddha, some sections cannot be traced in the Pali Canon as it stands today. Either text has been lost, or portions of this sutta have been expanded. ",
  "dn28:2.14": "Perhaps a reference to his enlightenment experience in [mn74](). ",
  "dn28:3.3": "Also at [dn16:3.50.5](), etc. ",
  "dn28:4.2": "The primary source is the SN 35, the Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields. ",
  "dn28:5.3": "The Bodhisatta is said elsewhere to be conceived in awareness (eg. [dn16:3.15.1]()), but this systematic analysis is found only here and at [dn33:1.11.176](). It seems like an abrupt shift from central Dhamma topics. ",
  "dn28:6.2": "Called “demonstrations of revealing” (_ādesanāpāṭihāriya_) at [an3.60:9.1](). ",
  "dn28:7.3": "Meditation is described in this way only in [mn136:9.1]() and [dn1:1.31.1]() where, as here, it is pursued by an “ascetic or brahmin”, who in those cases is not Buddhist. Here, however, it sounds like Sāriputta is talking about a Buddhist practice. The _asubha_ contemplation of the parts of the body is described in several places in the canon (eg. [dn22:5.1]()), but never exactly like this. ",
  "dn28:7.8": "The remaining practices are unique to this passage. This is perhaps related to the contemplation of death. ",
  "dn28:7.13": "This is a unique description of the process of rebirth. Consciousness is a “stream” in that it flows and moves, ever-changing, and is not a static self-same entity. To be “established” (_patiṭṭhita_) is to be attached because of craving. The phrase “uninterrupted on both sides” (_ubhayato abbocchinnaṁ_) is unique. I think the sense is that one’s consciousness is consistent with regards to this world and the next. If one is attached to this world, one will be attached to the next, and vice versa in the next section. ",
  "dn28:8.3": "As at [an7.14:1.3](). ",
  "dn28:9.2": "Normally we would expect the four kinds of right striving here. This is the only place the seven awakening factors are described in this way. ",
  "dn28:10.1": "As at [an4.166](). ",
  "dn28:11.2": "These descriptions are unique. _Vebhūtiya_ is only used here and DN 30, where the context shows it is a synonym for _pesuṇiya_. ",
  "dn28:12.1": "The Mahāsaṅgīti omits a heading for this section. ",
  "dn28:12.2": "The sequence from _satimā_ to _dhitimā_ is related to the good qualities of Ānanda ([an1.220:1.1]()), and pertain to textual fluency. _Satimā_ here is “memory”, not “mindfulness”, which is _sato_ at the end. ",
  "dn28:13.2": "We don’t find this exact passage elsewhere, but it is similar to [an10.46](). When the Buddha speaks of future consequences it is conditional. He is not a fortune-teller, but he understands the results of the practice. ",
  "dn28:13.3": "_Paccattaṁ yonisomanasikārā_ occurs at [sn46.8:2.1]() and [mn50:3.1](), where it means “investigate inside oneself”. Here it is applied to another. ",
  "dn28:13.4": "",
  "dn28:15.7": "PTS has na jānāmi. Neither text has variants, and comm and tika are silent. Anyway, either works. ",
  "dn28:15.10": "PTS has twenty. ",
  "dn28:19.14": "here the abhi-in abbhanujanati doesn’t have an elevated sense, but the “meta-” sense: you grant this regarding one but not the other. "
