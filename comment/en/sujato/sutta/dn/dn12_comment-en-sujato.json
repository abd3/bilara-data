  "dn12:1.2": "This is the only appearance of a place called Sālavatikā (“Abounding in Sal trees”). A courtesan of Rājagaha named Sālavatī appears in [Kd 8:1.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#1.3.1); she might perhaps have come from there. ",
  "dn12:1.3": "A certain brahmin Lohicca also appears in [sn35.132](). But since that is set far away in Avantī after the Buddha’s passing, and since in both cases he is said to have taken refuge, it seems likely these are different people. ",
  "dn12:2.2": "A similar view is sometimes unjustly imputed to the Theravādins, that they are only interested in their own liberation. ",
  "dn12:4.1": "While _nhāpita_ would seem to be identical with _nhāpaka_ (“bathroom attendant”), it is usually translated per Ja 395 where it means “barber”. ",
  "dn12:4.5": "Note the unusual use of _kira_ in this idiom, found in [sn35.133:2.3]() {mn85:3.5](), [mn127:2.5](), and [ud2.8:6.8](). I think this expresses polite deference, and render with “might” rather than “would”. ",
  "dn12:8.9": "It seems the barber was not only a trusted confidant, but an intelligent man with sincere concern for Lohicca’s well being. ",
  "dn12:17.4": "Note that at DN 29, the opposite formulation is samādāya taṁ dhammaṁ vattati ",
  "dn12:78.2": "At Thag 16.8, naraka is clearly a term for a cliff in a normal sense. Better to assume a naturalistic meaning here. "
