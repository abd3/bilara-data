  "dn13:1.3": "Aciravatī is called Rapti today. It was one of the great rivers that flowed from the Himalayas through Kosala into the Ganges. ",
  "dn13:3.1": "Similar discussions are found in [mn98]() = [snp3.9]() and [dn27](). ",
  "dn13:4.2": "It is not clear how this fits with Pokkharasādi’s conversion. Perhaps this was earlier, or perhaps he was simply teaching the Buddha’s path. | _Brahmasahabyatā_ does not mean “union with Brahmā” but rather “rebirth as one of the members of Brahma’s retinue” (see eg. [an5.34:9.4]()). The non-dualist concept that the limited personal self merges with the cosmic divinity is expressed in Pali, rather, with such phrases as _so attā so loko_ (“the self is identical with the cosmos”). ",
  "dn13:5.2": "It seems we never meet Tārukkha and he is only mentioned in his absence. In Rig Veda 8.46.32 a certain Balbūtha Tarukṣa the Dāsa makes an offering to a sage, so it seems the name has a non-Aryan origin. There is a Tārukṣya of Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6.1 who taught that union with Brahmā arose with the conjunction of speech and breath, which could well be the theory alluded to here. Sāyaṇa, the Rig Vedic commentator, says Tārukṣya was a guardian of cows, evidently alluding to the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, which describes Tārukṣya as a guardian of his teacher’s cows. Hiraṇyakeśīgṛhyasūtra 2.8.19 also mentions him, there spelled Tarukṣa. ",
  "dn13:10.2": "Identified in Jayatilleke’s *Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge*, p. 480. Their texts are respectively: Śatapathabrāhmaṇa (incl. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad); Taittirīyabrāhmaṇa; Chāndogyabrāhmaṇa; and Bahvṛcabrāhmaṇa (incorporated in Aitareya and Kauśītaki). I use the variant _bavhadija_ since it is closest to the Sanskrit _bahvṛca_. ",
  "dn13:10.3": "Today we say “many roads up the same mountain”. ",
  "dn13:14.11": "“No demonstrable basis” is _appāṭihīrakataṁ_. ",
  "dn13:25.2": "The bulk of the Vedic texts consist of prayers and invocations to various gods. ",
  "dn13:36.2": "I wonder if this is a satire on the idea of _upaniṣad_ (“sitting near”); even as they affirm their commitment to their texts, they drift apart (_visāra_) into separate schools and ideologies. ",
  "dn13:39.2": "The close _-ti_ has apparently confused some editors; Vāseṭṭha is quoting what he has heard. ",
  "dn13:76.1": "Here the four _brahmavihāras_ (“meditations of Brahmā”) replace the normal four _jhānas_. _Brahmavihāras_ are simply one of the means by which _jhānas_ may be attained, chosen here to fit the stated goal of teaching the path to Brahmā. ",
  "dn13:77.2": "The consciousness of _jhāna _ is so powerful that it effectively overrides any limited kamma. ",
  "dn13:78.1": "This is the quality of empathy with the suffering of another or oneself and the wish to remove it. ",
  "dn13:78.2": "This is rejoicing and celebrating in the success of others or oneself. ",
  "dn13:78.3": "Equanimity is not indifference, which is why it emerges only at the end. It is literally “close watching” without interfering but standing ready when needed. ",
  "dn13:81.10": "Here the entire concluding section of the Gradual Training dealing with wisdom is omitted, as the aim is limited to teaching rebirth with Brahmā to Brahmanical laypeople, rather than teaching liberation. Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja later applied to ordain, in which time the Buddha taught the full path to Nibbana ([dn27:7.8]()). "
