  "dn13:4.2": "It is not clear how this fits with Pokkharasāti’s conversion. Perhaps this was earlier, or perhaps he was simply teaching the Buddha‘s path. _Brahmasahabyatā_ does not mean “union with Brahmā” but rather “rebirth as one of the members of Brahma’s retinue” (see eg. [an5.34:9.4]()). ",

Skt is Bahvṛca. I use the variant Bavhadija since it is closest to that. Note that Jayatilleke quotes RD SBE 11 as giving the variant Bavharija, but this is incorrect, in fact he has the same variant as PTS, i.e. Bavhadija. Bavharija would be preferable, but I can’t find it attested. ",
