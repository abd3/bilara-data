  "dn5:1.2": "Khāṇumata is only mentioned here. It means “stumpy”, perhaps indicating that it was, or had recently been, a rough out-of-the-way place. ",
  "dn5:1.3": "Ambalaṭṭhikā means “place of mango saplings”. ",
  "dn5:1.4": "Like the town Khāṇumata, the brahmin Kūṭadanta appears only here. His name means “pointy teeth”, but there is no evidence that he was a vampire. ",
  "dn5:1.6": "At [snp2.7:26.1](), the sacrifice of cows in particular was said to be the nadir of decline for brahmins. ",
  "dn5:4.3": "News of the Buddha had spread in Brahmanical circles. In [dn3]() we saw the Buddha use his rhetorical technique of adapting his teaching to reframe Brahmanical doctrines in order to establish a common ground. Here we see the downside to such techniques, as the details of the reframing have been lost. ",
  "dn5:9.7": "Kūṭadanta’s proposal that the Buddha advise him on the sacrifice of 700 animals is outrageous. Nonetheless, the Buddha responds politely since Kūṭadanta is being polite. ",
  "dn5:10.1": "Mahāvijita means “Great Dominion”. He seems to be only known from this story. The idiom _bhūtapubbaṁ_ (“so it was in the past”) introduces legendary narratives of usually dubious historicity, like the English idiom “once upon a time”. ",
  "dn5:10.2": "In the Pali, meaningful thoughts often occur to people when withdrawn in seclusion. This doesn’t necessary mean they were in formal meditation. ",

  "dn5:11.2": "Then, as today, government policy was driven by the perception of rising crime rate. This whole passage is one of the Buddha’s most important statements on public policy. It is expressed through storytelling, giving a good example of how myths were invoked as rationales for current policy. ",
  "dn5:11.3": "“Taxes” is _bali_. He would have had to press his people for the extra funds to hold the sacrifice. ",
  "dn5:11.6": "The priest knows that the king will respond better to a pragmatic argument than a moral one. As always, the Buddha looks to eradicating the cause, not the symptom. ",
  "dn5:11.7": "Effective social policy requires a forward-thinking plan, not just reacting to grievances. ",
  "dn5:11.8": "The king should spend his own resources to support his citizens in the various occupations. ",
  "dn5:11.11": "Here the priest identifies a fundamental cause of social unrest and disorder. ",
  "dn5:11.12": "The king spends out of pocket, but the economy flourishes, so tax revenues increase even though he has not raised taxes. This is the essence of Keynesian economic theory. ",
  "dn5:11.13": "_Khema_ means a place of safety and sanctuary, where both humans and animals have no fear. It stems from the idea of an “oasis”, a place where, in times long before the Buddha, the wandering Indo-Europeans pastoralists would unyoke their beasts and rest for the evening. ",
  "dn5:11.14": "A good leader listens to advice. ",
