  "dn15:1.2": "The Kurukṣetra was an ancient Brahmanical kingdom situated in the region around modern Delhi, bordered by the Ganges in the east, the Sarasvatī in the west, the Himalayas in the north, and the hills of the Aravalli Range in the south. The Mahābharata climaxes with the battle fought there between the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas. These events, to the extent that they can be established historically, took place several centuries before the Buddha. Kuru marks the north-western extent of the Buddha’s travels. Kammāsadamma is identified with modern Kumashpur in Haryana, about 40km north of Delhi. ",
  "dn15:1.3": "While we cannot date this text, the fact that Ānanda has evidently been studying deep matters for a long time, that it takes place outside the Buddha’s normal range, and that it builds on teachings found elsewhere, suggests that it happened rather late in the Buddha’s life. At [sn12.60]() we find the same introduction to a much shorter discourse. ",
  "dn15:1.5": "At [sn6.1:1.6]() (and [dn14:3.1.6]() in the case of Vipassī), the Buddha hesitated to teach the Dhamma because dependent origination is so hard to see. Ānanda was not only learned and wise, he was a stream enterer who had directly experienced dependent origination ([an10.92:6.1]()), yet he still underestimates it. ",
  "dn15:1.7": "The remainder of the sutta illustrates subtle and profound implications and dimensions of dependent origination. ",
  "dn15:1.8": "Here the Buddha establishes the primary purpose of dependent origination: to understand transmigration so as to be free from it. ",
  "dn15:2.1": "Dependent origination looks for a “specific condition” (_idappacaya_) to explain suffering. It is not merely an abstract principle that “everything has a cause” or that “all things are interrelated”. ",
  "dn15:2.2": "Rebirth is a necessary antecedent condition for old age and death. Note that it is not a sufficient condition for old age in particular, for many people die when young. ",
  "dn15:2.4": "_Bhava_ means “being, existence, life”. It is a countable noun, and refers to the ongoing process of continued existence in many lives. By itself, _bhava_ has a positive connotation, and represents the longing that many people have to continue to exist after death in a permanent and happy state. The Buddha, however, situates it as just one more dimension of the flow of conditions. ",
  "dn15:22.2": "The question here is how the synonyms samudaya and sambhava are to be treated. This phrase only occurs elsewhere at MN 138, where we have “āyatiṁ jātijarāmaraṇadukkhasamudayasambhavo na hoti”. There, in his later rendering, BB has “origination of suffering—of birth, ageing, and death in the future”. Thus he maintains a rendering that essentially collapses the synonyms. RD has “be manifested that concatenation of rebirth, old age, death and the uprising of Ill”. MW has “an arising and coming to be”. Ṭhānissaro has “coming-into-play of the origination”. Now, dukkhasamudaya occurs a couple hundred times elsewhere, invariably in the sense “origin of suffering”. I think we should take it here in the same sense, which would agree with the syntax of RD’s rendering. Comm has “Dukkhasamudayasambhavoti dukkharāsisambhavo”, which at least suggests that dukkhasamudaya is to some degree separate from the rest. At MN 138 it is “Jātijarāmaraṇadukkhasamudayasambhavoti jātijarāmaraṇassa ceva avasesassa ca dukkhassa nibbatti na hotīti attho”. Here, nibbatti applies equally to jati, etc. and dukkha. Also, among the PTS vll. we have “dukkhasamudayo sambhavo”. ",
  "dn15:22.6": "ettāvatā vaṭṭaṁ vattati itthattaṁ paññāpanāya is tricky. Ṭhānissaro has “the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting (discernibility) of this world”. This is tempting, but elsewhere pannapanaya is as expected governed by the genitive in such constructions, eg rūpakkhandhassa paññāpanāya. BB here follows comm “namapannati”. But this phrase must surely be translated with eg SN 22.56 “Ye kevalino vaṭṭaṁ tesaṁ natthi paññāpanāya.” “For consummate ones, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found.” There BB has “there is no round for describing them”. At MN 22 he has “there is no [future] round for manifestation”. By his comment on SN 22.56 he is more or less agnostic on these readings. In DN 15 he has “the round turns for describing this state of being”. But I find all these renderings borderline incomprehensible. aññamaññapaccayatā pavattati. is inserted from Comm. ",
  "dn15:30.3": "Comm appears to support the PTS reading “asmiti” ",
