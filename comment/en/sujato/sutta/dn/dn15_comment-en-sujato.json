  "dn15:1.2": "The Kurukṣetra was an ancient Brahmanical kingdom situated in the region around modern Delhi, bordered by the Ganges in the east, the Sarasvatī in the west, the Himalayas in the north, and the hills of the Aravalli Range in the south. The Mahābharata climaxes with the battle fought there between the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas. These events, to the extent that they can be established historically, took place several centuries before the Buddha. Kuru marks the north-western extent of the Buddha’s travels. Kammāsadamma is identified with modern Kumashpur in Haryana, about 40km north of Delhi. ",
  "dn15:1.3": "While we cannot date this text, the fact that Ānanda has evidently been studying deep matters for a long time, that it takes place outside the Buddha’s normal range, and that it builds on teachings found elsewhere, suggests that it happened rather late in the Buddha’s life. At [sn12.60]() we find the same introduction to a much shorter discourse. ",
  "dn15:1.5": "At [sn6.1:1.6]() (and [dn14:3.1.6]() in the case of Vipassī), the Buddha hesitated to teach the Dhamma because dependent origination is so hard to see. Ānanda was not only learned and wise, he was a stream enterer who had directly experienced dependent origination ([an10.92:6.1]()), yet he still underestimates it. ",
  "dn15:1.7": "The sutta goes on to introduce subtle variations in the standard formula that allow it to draw out hidden implications and dimensions. ",
  "dn15:1.8": "Here the Buddha establishes the primary purpose of dependent origination: to understand transmigration so as to be free from it. ",
  "dn15:2.1": "Dependent origination looks for a “specific condition” (_idappacaya_) to explain suffering. It is not merely an abstract principle that “everything has a cause” or that “all things are interrelated”. ",
  "dn15:2.2": "Rebirth is a necessary antecedent condition for old age and death. Note that it is not a sufficient condition for old age in particular, for many people die when young. ",
  "dn15:2.4": "_Bhava_ means “being, existence, life”. It refers to the ongoing process of continued existence in many lives. By itself, _bhava_ has a positive connotation, and represents the longing that many people have to continue to exist after death in a permanent and happy state. The Buddha, however, situates it as just one more dimension of the flow of conditions. ",
  "dn15:2.6": "“Grasping” (_upādāna_) has the active sense of “taking up” a new life. It has a dual sense, because it also means the “fuel” that sustains the fire of existence. ",
  "dn15:2.8": "“Craving” is literally “thirst” (_taṇhā_), the fundamental desire or wanting. ",
  "dn15:2.10": "“Feeling” in translations of Pali refers to an idea much more basic than the complex concept of “emotion”. It translates _vedanā_, which lies close in meaning to “experience”. It refers to the hedonic tone of any experience as pleasant, painful, or neutral. ",
  "dn15:2.12": "“Contact” is literally “touch” (_phassa_), and refers to the stimulation that occurs when sense object meets sense organ in experience. ",
  "dn15:2.14": "Here we encounter the first unique feature of this sequence, as normally the six sense fields appear as the condition for contact. The reason for this becomes clear later on. Originally, “name” (_nāma_) meant the concepts or labels that are applied to the manifold “forms” (_rūpa_) that appear in the world, especially the “sentient organisms” such as we human beings. Elsewhere, the Buddha treated “name” more analytically as feeling, perception, intention, contact, and attention, and “form” as the four elements and derived matter ([mn9:52-54.7](), [sn12.2:11.1]()). ",
  "dn15:2.16": "“Consciousness” (_viññāṇa_) is simple subjective awareness, the sense of knowing. It arises stimulated by either an external sense impression or a mental phenomena such as thought, memory, etc. Thus it is the simple, primary reality of subjective awareness that makes the entire multiform world of concepts and appearances possible. ",
  "dn15:2.17": "The great sage Yājñavalkya identified _viññāṇa_ with the highest Self, arguing that name and form dissolve into “this Great Being, infinite, unbounded, a sheer mass of consciousness” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.2.12: _idaṃ mahad bhūtam anantam apāraṃ vijñānaghana eva_). But the Buddha showed that consciousness is equally dependent: without a specific stimulus, consciousness does not arise. ",
  "dn15:2.18": "The mutual conditioning of consciousness with name and form is a further subtlety of this presentation. We have met this idea before in [dn14:2.18.43](); it also occurs in [sn12.65]() and [sn12.67](). Again, implications of this are explored below. ",
  "dn15:3.1": "The entire sequence is recapped in forward order. ",
  "dn15:4.1": "The Buddha now takes up each of the terms in more depth. ",
  "dn15:4.2": "This emphatic phrasing clarifies that _nirodha_ (“cessation”) is not simply temporary suppression or non-arising, but is permanent and complete absence. ",
  "dn15:4.3": "“Rebirth” (_jāti_) is defined as the birth of a new life, not as simple arising. ",
  "dn15:4.5": "The various terms for “cause” are used as synonyms (_hetu_, _nidāna_, _samudaya_, _paccaya_). The purpose of using different terms is not to add nuances, but to reinforce the central meaning and guard against the corruption of meaning; if one word is lost or misunderstood, the meaning of the sentence as a whole is not changed. ",
  "dn15:5.3": "These realms relate to the kamma that projects consciousness into them. The realms of “luminous form” (_rūpabhava_) and the “formless” (_arūpabhava_) are generated by the form and formless attainments respectively. Any other kamma, good or bad, pertains to the sensual realm (_kāmabhava_). All rebirth takes place in one or other of these realms. ",
  "dn15:6.3": "“Grasping” begins with the primal desire of the senses, but the three other graspings are rather intellectual and sophisticated. Only a grown human being with a developed linguistic ability is able to formulate a view to become attached to, and likewise with attachment to religious observances and vows, and to theories of a self. This is why the bulk of kamma is produced by adult humans, rather than by, say, animals or children, for whom these dimensions of grasping are embryonic. ",
  "dn15:7.3": "“Craving” is a fundamental desire or urge. Unlike grasping, it is fully active in children and animals. Often it has a threefold definition, which we find below, but in dependent origination it is usually defined in terms of the six senses, which relates it to the items to come. ",
  "dn15:8.3": "Again, in dependent origination the usual threefold definition of feeling (pleasant, painful, neutral) is re-framed in terms of the six senses. ",
  "dn15:9.1": "Here the Buddha introduces another, even more radical, departure from the typical sequence. Rather than continue back to contact and name and form, he branches out in an entirely new direction. These “nine things rooted in craving” are found independently at [an9.23:1.2]() and [dn34:2.2.31](), but only here are they integrated with the standard dependent origination. ",
  "dn15:9.2": "While the purpose of the main dependent origination is to disclose the web of conditions that generates the suffering of transmigration, here the Buddha looks at the arising of social conflict and disorder. It is the application of similar principles in a different domain. ",
  "dn15:10.1": "In [dn27]() Aggaññasutta the Buddha narrates a legend showing how these things arise. The point is not that we should not safeguard (_ārakkha_) our possessions. It is, rather, that so long as we live in a world where safeguarding possessions is necessary, there will be conflict and violence. ",
  "dn15:11.1": "“Stinginess” is _macchariya_. ",
  "dn15:13.1": "There are many words in Pali that approximate the English word “attachment”. Here it is _ajjhosāna_. ",
  "dn15:15.1": "“Assessing” is _vinicchaya_, which might be translated as “judgment”. We like to weigh up and consider the pros and cons of different objects of desire. ",
  "dn15:16.1": "Those who have nothing are grateful for any small thing, and do not indulge in picking and choosing. ",
  "dn15:17.1": "Our senses are tuned to hunt out and acquire pleasure. ",
  "dn15:18.1": "Here we rejoin the standard sequence. ",
  "dn15:18.3": "This is the normal definition of craving in the four noble truths. Both definitions are included in this sutta to show that they do not contradict, but rather disclose different aspects of the same thing. It is not just sensual desire that drives acquisition. For example, religious people fight over sacred ground or holy objects to gain a place in heaven; or else those driven by nihilism go to any lengths for alcohol or drugs to erase existence. ",
  "dn15:18.6": "The threefold analysis of feeling leads to the process of acquisition, while the sixfold analysis of feeling leads to dependent origination. ",
  "dn15:19.1": "And now we rejoin the main sequence. ",
  "dn15:19.3": "People mostly want to enjoy pleasant sensations, in this life and the next, but those sensations depend on a constant supply of the appropriate stimuli. ",
  "dn15:20.1": "Nowhere else is this condition expressed in this way, and the sutta goes on to develop a unique analysis to explain it. ",
  "dn15:20.2": "The “set of mental phenomena known as name” is _nāmakāya_. Its function depends not any underlying essence, but on the “features” by which it is “made known”; it is a phenomenological analysis. “Labeling contact” is _adhivacanasamphassa_; it is the active process by which the mind makes sense of the world by attaching labels to experience. This passage reinforces the linguistic significance of _nāma_. ",
  "dn15:20.4": "The “set of physical phenomena known as form” is _rūpakāya_, while “impingement contact” is _paṭighasamphassa_. Here _paṭigha_ refers to the “striking” of physical phenomena against each other, such as light “hitting” the eye. It most commonly appears in this sense in the formula that begins the formless attainments. ",
  "dn15:20.6": "Labeling moves from the mind to the world; impingement moves from the world to the mind. Together they create a dynamic two-way process by which we learn about the world and how to make sense of it. ",
  "dn15:20.8": "Contact is fundamentally a meeting, normally expressed as the coming together of the sense stimulus (light), the sense organ (eye), and sense consciousness. By skipping the direct mention of the six senses, the Buddha opens another perspective on this process: mental labeling meets sense impingement, each essential to the other, and together making contact possible. The analysis itself exemplifies this process, as it starts by looking at the process from each side, and moves towards integration, seeing them both together. ",
  "dn15:21.1": "Consciousness in dependent origination is normally defined as the six kinds of sense consciousness ([sn12:6.3]()). The purpose of this is to emphasize that the process of rebirth and transmigration is an empirical process, which depends on the same ordinary consciousness we are experiencing now. Here, once again, by skipping the six senses, a new mode of analysis opens up, which emphasizes the organic growth of the individual. ",
  "dn15:21.2": "“Conceived” is _okkamissatha_, literally “descend” or “arrive”. “Coagulate” assumes the PTS reading _samucchissatha_ (Sanskrit _sammurch_). I believe this echoes the belief that the embryo is “coagulated” from the mix of blood and semen. Linguistically, this passage through to [dn15:22.2]() is marked with the extremely rare verbal ending _-issatha_, which is the middle form of the third person singular conditional. ",
  "dn15:21.4": "“Miscarried” is _vokkamissatha_. “State of existence” is _itthattā_, which is most commonly found in the declaration of the arahant that they will no longer be reborn into “this state of existence”. Here “born” is _abhinibbatti_, which is listed along with _jāti_, _okkanti_ and other terms as a synonym in the standard definition of rebirth ([sn12.2:4.2](), [mn9:24-26.7](), [dn22:18.4]()). ",
  "dn15:21.6": "The connection between dependent origination and childhood development is further explored in [mn38:28.1](). ",
  "dn15:22.1": "Now we turn to the mirror side of the pair of conditions. ",
  "dn15:22.2": "Just as name and form—the organic, sensual, and sense-making body—cannot grow without consciousness, so too consciousness must acquire a landing or grounding place to be “planted” in name and form. _Dukkhasamudayasambhavo_ (“the coming to be of the origin of suffering”) might be rendered “the coming to be and origin of suffering”. However, _dukkhasamudaya_ occurs some hundreds of times in the sense “origin of suffering” so I take it in the same way here. This is supported by the PTS variant reading _dukkhasamudayo sambhavo_. ",
  "dn15:22.5": "This passage continues to employ rare middle forms, this time _-etha_, the third person singular optative. ",
  "dn15:22.6": "This passage explains why the sequence ends here rather than proceeding in the usual way to choices and ignorance. Any state of being ultimately depends on the codependency of name and form with consciousness. Within this key relationship is the extent not only of language, but also of wisdom, and the secret to the undoing of transmigration itself. One of the many profound implications of this is that there is no such thing as a state of pure consciousness independent of concepts. _Ettāvatā vaṭṭaṁ vattati itthattaṁ paññāpanāya_ should be read with such passages as [sn22.56:5.3](): _ye kevalino vaṭṭaṁ tesaṁ natthi paññāpanāya_ (“For consummate ones, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found”). The Mahāsaṅgīti reading _aññamaññapaccayatā pavattati_ should be rejected, since it inserts an Abhidhamma concept from the commentary. ",
  "dn15:23.1": "The text now turns to an analysis of theories of “self” (_attā_), which is comparable to some of the passages of [dn1](). The Buddha began his discourse by stating that it is the failure to understand dependent origination that keeps beings trapped in transmigration. Dependent origination explains transmigration in a purely empirical way by inferring from the mental and physical phenomena we experience here and now. Self theorists, on the other hand, explain transmigration by introducing a new metaphysical principle, the “self” or “soul”, by which they assume that the individual has an eternal underlying essence. ",
  "dn15:23.2": "“Physical” is _rūpī_ (“possessing form”). If something were really the core essence of a person, you would think it is readily knowable. But the Buddha shows that theorists describe the self in multiple different and incompatible ways. Each of these draws on some more-or-less arbitrary aspect of empirical reality, such as “form”, to describe an unknowable metaphysical entity that is in fact just pure supposition. ",
  "dn15:23.3": "An example of a self that is “physical and limited” would be the body. ",
  "dn15:23.5": "Such as the cosmos. ",
  "dn15:23.7": "Perhaps this is the self of “limited perception” ([dn1:2.38.13]()). This would be where the mind is aware of something limited, and the self is identified with the mental dimension of that awareness. ",
  "dn15:23.9": "Such as the formless dimensions. ",
  "dn15:24.2": "The three options (“it is”, “it will be so”, and “I will make it be so”) illustrate how the theorist resorts to ever more convoluted means to justify the lack of empirical support for their pet theory. _Bhāviṁ_ (“sure to become”) is the root _bhū_ with the primary affix _-ī_, which connotes an inevitable future state. _Tattha_ (“in some other place”, literally “there”) is explained by the commentary as _paraloke_ (“in the next world”). ",
  "dn15:24.3": "Their surface differences rest on the same underlying assumption, so if the assumption is disproven there is no need to refute each individual theory. _Iccālaṁ_ resolves to _iti alaṁ_. ",
  "dn15:25.1": "This is the Buddha, who does not theorize a metaphysical self. Implicit in this argument is Occam’s razor, “entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity”. Since the self theorists want to prove the existence of the “self”, it is up to them to supply the grounds to support their suppositions. Since they fail to do so, the rational position is that there is no self. The Buddha is not under a similar obligation to prove the non-existence of the “self”, since it is reasonable to assume that things do not exist until the evidence says otherwise. ",
  "dn15:27.1": "Having asserted a metaphysical “self”, the theorists go on to make certain observations and interpretations regarding it. ",
  "dn15:30.3": "Comm appears to support the PTS reading “asmiti” ",
  "dn15:36.1": "Cp. AN 9.41 "
