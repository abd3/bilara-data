  "dn34:1.1.3": "This discourse is similar to [dn33](); seventy items are shared between the two. Here Sāriputta teaches without prompting. The scheme is more rigorous; items listed according to a specific pattern, then the same pattern is amplified one by one. Such details might suggest this sutta is a little later than [dn33](0. But such conclusions should be drawn cautiously; in at least one detail, absence of the _asura_ realm from the “lost opportunities”, this sutta is earlier. ",
  "dn34:1.1.7": "The use of a verse to introduce the teachings is unusual. ",
  "dn34:1.2.1": "Each number from one to ten follows this same scheme. ",

  "dn34:1.2.5": "Compare [sn16.11:12.2](). ",
  "dn34:1.2.9": "Compare [sn22.48:2.2](), but this is the five aggregates rather than contact. ",
  "dn34:1.2.20": "This term is only found in the Ratanasutta ([snp2.1:5.2]()). It means a kind of meditation that results in the realization of the Dhamma in this very life. ",

  "dn34:1.5.31": "In my view, this is almost certainly a mistake. Four sannas are more plausibly described in this way at AN 4.179. The sanskrit text at SF 107 has the four noble truths, which makes much more sense. ",
