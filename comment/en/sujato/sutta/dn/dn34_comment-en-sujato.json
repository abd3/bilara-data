  "dn34:1.1.3": "This discourse is similar to [dn33](); seventy items are shared between the two. Here Sāriputta teaches without prompting. The scheme is more rigorous; items listed according to a specific pattern, then the same pattern is amplified one by one. The constraints of this scheme mean that, while almost all the items listed here are found elsewhere, they are mostly not known by the name used here. Such details might suggest this sutta is a little later than [dn33](0. But such conclusions should be drawn cautiously; in at least one detail, absence of the _asura_ realm from the “lost opportunities”, this sutta is earlier. ",
  "dn34:1.1.7": "The use of a verse to introduce the teachings is unusual. ",
  "dn34:1.2.1": "Each number from one to ten follows this same scheme. ",

  "dn34:1.2.5": "Compare [sn16.11:12.2](). ",
  "dn34:1.2.9": "Compare [sn22.48:2.2](), but this is the five aggregates rather than contact. ",
  "dn34:1.2.20": "This term is only found in the Ratanasutta ([snp2.1:5.2]()). It means a kind of meditation that results in the realization of the Dhamma in this very life. ",

  "dn34:1.3.25": "“Knowledge of ending” (_khaye ñāṇaṁ_) refers to the aggregates; it is discussed at [sn12.23](). “Knowledge of non-arising” (_anuppāde ñāṇaṁ_) is the knowledge that one will not be born again. ",
