  "dn29:1.3": "When this event is mentioned at [mn104:2.1]() the Buddha is also in the Sakyan lands, but near the village of Sāma. Both texts tell the story of Cunda conveying the news via Ānanda at Sāma, which was presumably near the Vedhaññā’s mango grove. It does seem strange that two distinct discourses are recorded from the same prompt, but then, why shouldn’t the Buddha give more than one teaching on such an important topic? At [dn33:1.6.1]() the Buddha is at Pāvā in the Mallian lands, and the discourse is spoken by Sāriputta there. Given the evident lateness of DN 33 this is a less convincing framework. A parallel to MN 104 (MĀ 196 at T I 752c12) says he was in the Vajjian lands at the time; both Sakya and Vajji border on Mallā. To further add to the confusion, according to the Jain tradition, Mahāvīra died after the Buddha, and it was at a different Pāvā in Magadha. ",
  "dn29:1.6": "A sardonic slight on the movement whose signature virtue was non-violence. ",
  "dn29:1.7": "“With broken monument” (_bhinnathupe_) is used only in this context. When a great teacher or leader died, a “monument” was built to keep their memory alive. The breaking of a monument—whether physical or symbolic—was, in a way, truly killing them. ",
  "dn29:2.1": "Apart from the events described here, we hear of Sāma only once ([an6.21]()). The topic there is the decline of the Saṅgha, hinting at a connection with these events. Cunda took the time to complete his rains residence before conveying the news, which conveys something of the speed with which news traveled in those days—slowly. ",
  "dn29:4.1": "This harsh critique is repeated at [mn104:2.5]() and [dn33:1.6.5](). ",
  "dn29:4.8": "The Dhamma is primary, not the teacher. This is applied to Buddhism as well; for example, a student is expected to help a mentor who is falling away from Dhamma [pli-tv-kd1:25.20.1](). ",

  "dn29:8.2": "“Collected sayings” is _saṅgāhapada_. This is a unique term, but the sense seems to be that the process of gathering  and organizing teachings is incomplete. ",

  "dn29:24.2": "RD and MW phrase this as a question, which is unjustified. ",
  "dn29:26.2": "Both RD and MW take dhamma in (at)thitadhamma here as “doctrine”, but it is at AN 8.19 in the same context, but of the ocean, where it just means “stable”. Both places are glossed as ṭhitasabhāvā. Incidentally, the context here shows that PTS dict’s “eternal” for AN 8.19 is wrong. "
