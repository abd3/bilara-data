  "dn29:1.3": "When this event is mentioned at [mn104:2.1]() the Buddha is also in the Sakyan lands, but near the village of Sāma. Both texts tell the story of Cunda conveying the news via Ānanda at Sāma. Since we know nothing of the location of either Sāma or the Vedhañña’s mango grove, there is no reason why they should not have been near each other. It does seem strange that two distinct discourses are recorded from the same prompt, but then, why shouldn’t the Buddha give more than one teaching on such an important topic? At [dn33:1.6.1]() the Buddha is at Pāvā in the Mallian lands, and the discourse is spoken by Sāriputta there. Given the evident lateness of DN 33 this is a less convincing framework. A parallel to MN 104 (MĀ 196 at T I 752c12) says he was in the Vajjian lands at the time; both Sakya and Vajji border on Mallā. To further add to the confusion, according to the Jain tradition, Mahāvīra died after the Buddha, and it was at a different Pāvā in Magadha. ",
  "dn29:1.6": "A sardonic slight on the movement whose signature virtue was non-violence. ",
  "dn29:1.7": "“With broken monument” (_bhinnathupe_) is used only in this context. When a great teacher or leader died, a “monument” was built to keep their memory alive. The breaking of a monument—whether physical or symbolic—was, in a way, truly killing them. ",
  "dn29:4.11": "Cp. AN 1.320 ",
  "dn29:8.1": "Comm: aviññāpitatthāti abodhitatthā. I think this is a mistake. it is to be understood in line with the Buddha inviting the monks to question him on his deathbed. viññāpita is used in the sense “asked about or for”. ",
  "dn29:10.1": "Both RD and MW seem to take this as referring to a monk. But it refers to the Buddha, as is made clear in the recapitulation. ",
  "dn29:22.5": "Both MW and RD have optative mod here, but it is not justified. ",
  "dn29:24.2": "RD and MW phrase this as a question, which is unjustified. ",
  "dn29:26.2": "Both RD and MW take dhamma in (at)thitadhamma here as “doctrine”, but it is at AN 8.19 in the same context, but of the ocean, where it just means “stable”. Both places are glossed as ṭhitasabhāvā. Incidentally, the context here shows that PTS dict’s “eternal” for AN 8.19 is wrong. "
