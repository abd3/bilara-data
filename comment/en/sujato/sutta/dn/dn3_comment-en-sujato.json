  "dn3:1.1.2": "Icchānaṅgala was a center for the innovative brahmins of the Kosala region. It was to the east of Sāvatthī. ",
  "dn3:1.2.1": "Pokkharasāti is featured several times as a respected teacher of the Brahmins. ",
  "dn3:1.2.8": "Pokkharasāti does not care whether the Buddha identified as a brahmin following the Vedas. The wise do not concern themselves with religious identity. ",
  "dn3:1.3.1": "The three Vedas had already accrued an extensive ancillary literature. That there was an advanced science of linguistics is not in doubt, for within a century or so of the Buddha, Pāṇini created the Aṣṭādhyāyī, a work of linguistics so precise and sophisticated that its methods are still being discovered today. The “testaments” may have been early versions of the stories found in the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa. For _anuññātapaṭiññāta_ see [mn98:7.1.]() and [snp3.9:6.1.](). For _tevijjake pāvacane_ see [mn95:12.2.](). ",
  "dn3:1.3.2": "Almost the same words are spoken to the bodhisatta by his first teachers, Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta ([mn36:14.9]()). ",
  "dn3:1.4.9": "Following PTS and BJT editions of the parallel phrase at [mn91:4.9](), which read _tayā_ for _tathā_. ",
  "dn3:1.5.2": "The thirty-two marks feature prominently in the Buddhist texts as a Brahmanical doctrine. However, they are not found in any extant Brahmanical texts. The notion of a two-fold course for a great hero—worldly success or spiritual—can be traced back as far as the epic of Gilgamesh. ",
  "dn3:1.5.3": "The wheel-turning monarch draws from the Brahmanical horse sacrifice, which establishes the authority of a king from sea to sea. The Buddhist telling is divested of all coarse and violent elements. The wheeled chariot gave military supremacy to the ancient Indo-Europeans, allowing them to spread from their ancient homeland north of the Black Sea. In Buddhism, the wheel, which also has solar connotations, symbolizes unstoppable power. ",
  "dn3:1.5.6": "The sacrificial horse on its journey across the land is protected by a hundred sons. ",
  "dn3:1.5.9": "The relation between Pokkharasāti and Ambaṭṭha is similar to that between the Buddha and the arahants. They share the same understanding, but the Buddha is distinguished as the teacher. ",
  "dn3:1.6.1": "In this sutta, _māṇava_ is always applied to Ambaṭṭha, and _māṇavaka_ to the rest. It seems that the diminutive _māṇavaka_ means “young student” or perhaps “undergrad”. There are said to be _sambahula_ students, a word that is often translated as “many”. But later we see that they all fit inside the Buddha’s hut, so the sense must be “several”. ",
  "dn3:1.7.1": "This is the practice of walking meditation. Meditators pace mindfully up and down a smooth path, keeping attention on their body. ",
  "dn3:1.7.3": "_Bho_ is a respectful term of address used by brahmins. The forms of address used in Pali are complex, and it is rarely possible to map them to modern English with any precision. ",
  "dn3:1.7.4": "The parallel passage at [mn35:7.4]() has a different phrase here. ",
  "dn3:1.8.3": "The common term _kulaputta_ (literally, “son of a family”) typically refers to someone from a well-to-do or respected family, a “gentleman”. It is a gendered term which assumes the social status of men. ",
  "dn3:1.8.5": "The introduction has told us that the Buddha was staying in a forest at this time. Nonetheless, this was not a wilderness, but was developed enough to have huts with latched doors. ",
  "dn3:1.9.2": "",
  "dn3:1.9.5": "The Buddha draws attention to Ambaṭṭha’s rude behavior. Throughout the suttas, the manner in which people greet the Buddha gives us a hint as to their attitudes and qualities. ",
  "dn3:1.10.3": "Note the racial connotations of using _kaṇha_ “black” as a slur. The brahmin caste hailed from the (relatively) fair-skinned Indo-Europeans who entered India from the north and held themselves above the dark-skinned natives, especially those of the south. The word _ibbha_ (“primitive”) is derived from a local word for “elephant” (_ibha_), and I think it originally referred to the native inhabitants who tamed elephants. Both _samaṇas_ and Sakyas are associated with local native culture. ",
  "dn3:1.11.2": "Ambaṭṭha is “qualified” (_vusita_) in scriptures, but far from “qualified” in spiritual development. _Vusita_ is normally an expression of arahantship: _vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ_ (“the spiritual journey has been completed”). ",
  "dn3:1.12.6": "Both Rhys Davids and Walshe have “violent”, evidently after the PTS reading _rabhasa_. But _bhassa_ is the reading of the commentary: _bhassāti bahubhāṇino_. Moreover, the story below does not demonstrate violence. ",
  "dn3:1.14.2": "The Buddha’s use of _āyasmā_ is noteworthy here: he is taking a conciliatory tone. ",
  "dn3:1.15.5": "_Kaṇhāyana_ means “descendant of Kaṇha”. ",
  "dn3:1.15.6": "Normally I take _ayyaputta_ as a simple honorific, but here the sense is not that the Sakyans were the masters, but were descended from them. ",
  "dn3:1.15.7": "Okkāka (Sanskrit Ikṣvāku) was the legendary son of the first man, Manu, and the founder of the solar dynasty of Kosala. It is a Munda name, which may be associated with the introduction of cane sugar (_ikṣuḥ_) from eastern Asia. ",
  "dn3:1.15.10": "“Teak” is _sāka_, the first of two puns of the Sakyan name. This line identifies them with their northern home in the shadow of the Himalayas, and suggests that harvesting teak was a primary source of wealth. Compare Gilgamesh, for whom the Lebanese cedar was the foundation of his royal capital. ",
  "dn3:1.15.11": "“Own” is _saka_, the second pun on the Sakyan name. Incest is, of course, common if not normal among royal families, for exactly the reason stated here. For _sambheda_, see [an2.9]() = [dn26](), [an5.103]() = [an10.45](). In each case the sense is not “breaking, destroying”, but the dissolving of boundaries, resulting in promiscuity or leaking of secrets. ",
  "dn3:1.15.13": "For this sense of _sammati_, see [sn11.9](), [sn11.10](). ",
  "dn3:1.15.17": "This draws on both the puns above. But the commentary also explains _sakya_ here as “capable” (_samatthā, paṭibalā_) in reference to their survival against all odds, thus connecting Sakya with _sakka_ (“able”). ",
  "dn3:1.16.2": "The passage wavers between treating _kaṇha_ as a personal name, a description, or as a word for a goblin. I try to capture this ambiguity by using variations of “black boy”. Note that the text does not say who the father was. ",
  "dn3:1.16.4": "Like Siddhattha, he spoke as soon as he was born. The boy was no common child, but had a larger destiny. His words are a dramatic contrast with Siddhattha’s words of confident proclamation, and his birth which was devoid of filth or impurity. ",
  "dn3:1.17.2": "Lineage was important to brahmins, but the Brāhmaṇa and Upaniṣad literature shows that, as here, many were more concerned with conduct and wisdom than with birth. ",
  "dn3:1.20.3": "This is a conventional threat, inherited from brahmanical texts. ",
  "dn3:1.20.5": "In his rhetorical jousting with brahmins, the Buddha often displayed his detailed knowledge of their doctrines. ",
  "dn3:1.21.1": "Vajirapāṇī (“lightning-bolt in hand”) only appears here and in the parallel passage at [mn35:14.1](). The commentary identifies him with Sakka. Much later, Mahayana texts adopted the name for a fierce Bodhisattva who was protector of the Dhamma. ",
  "dn3:1.23.5": "The contemptuous senses of “black boy” represent the conservative brahmanical view, presented not as endorsement, but as a rhetorical means to undermine Ambaṭṭha’s pride. The Buddha now shows how a man of a supposedly low birth rose to great spiritual eminence. ",
  "dn3:1.23.6": "“Prime Spell” is _brahmamanta_, a term of unique occurrence in Pali. In modern Hinduism it is used for a verse of praise for Brahmā, but that is not what is meant here. Kaṇha is one of several “dark hermits” who accrued mighty and lineage-busting powers in the south. ",
  "dn3:1.23.8": "The stories of the Hindu deity Krishna and the Kaṇha of this story share some details in common, while other details differ. Most of the similarities are too generic to establish any historical connection. But Krishna won the hand of his seventh wife Lakṣmaṇā, also known as Madrī, at an archery contest. This detail is too precise to be a coincidence, and proves there must be some shared basis between the two figures. ",
  "dn3:1.23.13": "This draws on the ancient belief that the king’s acts affect the natural order of things. ",
  "dn3:1.23.16": "This sequence seems to be an etiological myth explaining certain rites of kingship and succession, and providing an origin story for this prayer. ",
  "dn3:1.23.17": "National prosperity is ensured through symbolic regicide. This was omitted from Frazer’s accounts of such substitute sacrifices. Here there is a double substitution: the prince substitutes for the king, and a threat substitutes for the act of killing. This suggests that, even from the legendary perspective of this story within a story, the rite was an ancient one that had evolved through multiple stages. ",
  "dn3:1.23.18": "The use of the bare personal name for the king is highly unusual. ",
  "dn3:1.23.21": "“Prime punishment” is _brahmadaṇḍa_, which harks back to the Prime Spell (_brahmamantra_). The Buddha had his own version of the _brahmadaṇḍa_, which was to give the silent treatment ([dn16:6.4.1]()). ",
  "dn3:1.23.22": "",
  "dn3:1.24.10": "In [mn56:19.2]() _āvaṭa_/_anāvaṭa_ is used in reference to Upāli “shutting his gate” against the Jains and opening it for the Buddhists. In [dn17:1.23.2]() _anāvaṭa_ means “open to the public”. ",
  "dn3:1.27.4": "This section seems implausible to me. ",
  "dn3:1.28.1": "Sanaṅkumāra (“Everyoung”) became a Hindu deity closely associated with the worship of Krishna. He first appears in the seventh chapter of the pre-Buddhist Chāndogyopaniṣad. There he teaches the learned Nārada what lies beyond the mere surface of words (_nāma_) by giving a progressive meditation that ultimately reveals the highest Self. Thus he is a perfect foil for Ambaṭṭha. ",
  "dn3:2.1.1": "To his credit, after that thorough humiliation, Ambaṭṭha is ready to learn. ",
  "dn3:2.1.2": "Reading _anuttarāya vijjācaraṇasampadāya_ as locative, in agreement with _yattha_ below. ",
  "dn3:2.1.7": "The Buddha emphasizes that his “knowledge and conduct” rejects the notion of birth that is so essential to Brahmanism. ",
  "dn3:2.2.7": "The Pali text abbreviates the gradual training in this sutta and those that follow. The reader is expected to understand it as it was taught in [dn2](). Note, however, that the suttas sometimes have small differences in their perspective that make reconstruction tricky. ",
  "dn3:2.3.1": "In later Theravada, _apāyamukha_ refers to deeds that cause rebirth in lower realms. However this meaning does not apply in the early texts; the acts described here are not evil, merely trifling. Rather, it means an “opening” (_mukha_) for “departure” (_apāya_). ",
  "dn3:2.3.4": "A common practice of pre-Buddhist hermits, who avoided the slightest harm to plants. Buddhist mendicants may also not harm plants, but they rely on alms and only eat fallen fruit in case of famine. ",
  "dn3:2.3.5": "The Buddha inverts Ambaṭṭha’s earlier claim that the other three castes only succeed in serving brahmins ([dn3:1.14.7]()). ",
  "dn3:2.3.8": "They harm the plants. ",
  "dn3:2.5.5": "Again the Buddha uses Ambaṭṭha’s words against him [dn3:1.13.1](). ",
  "dn3:2.6.3": "This practice is not elsewhere attested in early Pali. ",
  "dn3:2.7.1": "",
  "dn3:2.7.2": "_Ugga_ is a rare word whose root sense is “mighty”, but here it must be a noun. Given that it is a military man who consults with the king, I translate as “warrior-chief”. _Rājañña_ is used fairly rarely in the suttas; it is an archaic syonym for _khattiya_. ",
  "dn3:2.7.6": "Taking this and the next as one sentence, as per RD. ",
  "dn3:2.10.5": "veṭhakanatapassāhi is otherwise unattested. At MN 55 veṭhaka evidently means “collar”. The Lokuttaravada Bhikshuni Vinaya has a rule about this, Pn 3: https://suttacentral.net/skt/skt-lo-bi-pn3. Thullananda gets out of the water and wraps herself only in a vethaka. Here this seems to be synonymous with paṭṭaka, i.e. a strip of cloth. It is allowable if used to tie on a basket, etc. Edgerton’s BHS dict does not notice this occurrence, but says of a ref in Mahavastu “something that wraps, covers: in a list of goldsmith’s products”, noting however a number of variants. Nata is “curve”, passa is “side, flank”. MW has “flounces and furbelows”, RD “fringes and furbelows round their loins”. These are hopelessly prissy descriptions of what sounds like the clothes of a stripper or lap-dancer. ",
  "dn3:2.10.8": "This harks back to the opening of the sutta. vitudenti vitacchenti recurs at SN 19.1, of a bird being chased and pecked at by other birds. vitudenti by itself has the same meaning at Bu Pj 4. Evidently the Buddha was pretty disgusted with this maltreatment of the poor beasts. ",
  "dn3:2.15.2": "The diminutive ending here is the same as the in samanaka, which Ambattha used of the Buddha. As for using bloody for re; if we don’t use curse words here, when do we get to use them! ",
  "dn3:2.16.3": "Given his mood, this was very diplomatic of them! "
