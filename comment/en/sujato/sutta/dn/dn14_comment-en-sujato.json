  "dn14:1.1.2": "_Kareri_ is evidently _Miliusa tomentosa_, known as _hoom_ or _kari_ in Hindi. It is related to the custard apple, not the curry tree (_Murraya koenigii_). ",

  "dn14:1.4.1": "At [mn71:14.2]() and [sn42.9:4.5]() the Buddha says he recollects ninety-one eons, which must refer back to the life of Vipassī. We shall see the origin of his name below. ",

  "dn14:1.4.3": "_Vessabhū_ is Sanskrit Viśvabhṛt. It means “all-bearing”, probably originating as a word for the earth. It was the name of a legendary king, who apparently ruled over the city of Avantī ([dn19:36.14]()). ",
  "dn14:1.4.4": "Due to the appearance of four Buddhas in this cycle it is known as a “fortunate” (_bhadda_). Stories from Kakusandha’s day appear at [mn50]() and [sn15.20:2.8](). There is no obvious etymology for his name, but perhaps it stems from _kakud_ (“peak”) and thus “the union of the peaks”, a valley at the junction of mountains. ",
  "dn14:1.4.5": "The meaning of Koṇāgamana is unclear; in Sanskrit it is often spelled Kanakamuni, “the golden sage”; in the (dubious) Nigali Sagar Edict of Ashoka it is Konākamana. At [thig16.1:71.1]() we hear the past life of three nuns in the time of Koṇāgamana. ",
  "dn14:1.4.6": "Kassapa (Sanskrit Kaśyapa) means “tortoise”. It is a common Brahmanical clan name, stemming from an ancient figure reckoned as the eldest of the “seven sages”, to whom some Vedic verses are attributed. Stories of his time are found at [mn81]() and [sn48.57:3.1](). ",
  "dn14:1.4.7": "These numbers make up a quasi-logarithmic scale. In eon one there are four Buddhas. Thirty eons ago the number is halved, so they had two Buddhas. Twice-thirty eons before that, the number is halved again, to one Buddha, thus ending the scale. ",
  "dn14:1.5.7": "In ancient India, the “aristocrats” (_khattiya_) and the brahmins vied for the prestige of being the highest class. The traditional business of the aristocrats was in politics, agriculture, and war, while the brahmins were a hereditary priestly caste who served as advisers and ritualists. It is said that the Buddha-to-be was born in whatever caste was most prestigious at the time. ",

  "dn14:1.12.15": "Several constellations are distinguished as “former” (_pubba_) and “later” (_uttara_). Since it lies between Visākhā and Dhanavatī, this may be the 21st constellation, Uttara Āṣāḍhā (Sagittarius/Capricorn). ",

In addition, this detail and that about emerging mindfully from the womb are found at [an4.127](). ",
  "dn14:1.17.2": "“Normal” is _dhammatā_, a natural principle. This entire passage differs from the earliest concept of the bodhisatta (“one intent on awakening”), which in early texts is typically applied to Siddhattha after he left the home. ",
  "dn14:1.17.5": "_Asaṁvutā_ was translated by Ñāṇamoḷī as “abysmal”, but this relies on a commentarial cosmology that is not found in the suttas. The sense, rather, is “boundless”. The root harks back to the Vedic serpent Vṛtra who wraps the world in darkness. _Nānubhonti_ (“makes no impression”) is glossed in the commentary to [an4.127]() as _nappahonti_ “ineffective”. ",

  "dn14:1.24.1": "She is depicted standing while holding a tree in the pose known as _sālabhañjikā_. ",
  "dn14:1.29.1": "“Stands firm on his own feet” signifies that he will be awakened by his own efforts. “North” is _uttara_, which is also “the beyond”; this predicts his attaining Nibbana. “Seven strides” signifies crossing over the vast cycles of birth and death. The “white parasol” signifies purity and royalty. “Surveying all quarters” signifies his universal knowledge.

  "dn14:1.31.1": "Many of the details of the following account were later incorporated into the life of Gotama, under the principle that the major events of the lives of Buddhas follow a natural order. Nonetheless, they do not always agree with other accounts in early texts. ",
  "dn14:1.31.3": "In [snp3.11](), the newborn Siddhattha is examined by the dark hermit Asita, who was not identified as a brahmin. These two versions are combined in later accounts. ",
  "dn14:1.31.7": "Asita did not look at the 32 marks, and he predicted only one destiny: that he would become a Buddha. ",

  "dn14:1.32.35": "At [thig13.1:6.2]() Ambapālī describes her eyes as _abhinīla_. While some Indians do indeed have blue eyes, this probably describes a black so deep it appears blue. ",
  "dn14:1.32.38": "The _uṇhīsa_ is depicted as a bulge on the Buddha’s head, signifying his higher knowledge. Originally it probably just meant that his head was a regular oval shape. ",

  "dn14:1.34.1": "His birth mother has passed away and there is no mention of a step-mother. ",
  "dn14:1.36.1": "Normally clairvoyance and related abilities are said to arise due to the power of the fourth _jhāna_, whereas here it comes naturally due to past kamma. The difference is that after _jhāna_ the mind is entirely clear of hindrances. Here it seems to be a more limited ability to see clearly and in the dark. ",
  "dn14:1.37.2": "Vipassī’s name is simply the personal form of the word made famous in Buddhist meditation, _vipassanā_. This is usually rendered as “insight”, but the sense here is more like “clear seeing”. ",
  "dn14:1.37.4": "",
  "dn14:1.37.5": "Indian epistemology acknowledges two fundamental sources of knowledge: direct perception (_paccakkha_) and inference (_anumāna_). This passage shows that _vipassanā_ includes both. This is why I render _vipassanā_ with “discernment” in an attempt to capture both nuances, rather than the standard “insight”. ",
  "dn14:2.2.12": "“Brood” is _pajjhāyati_. He is having an existential crisis. ",
  "dn14:2.4.2": "In any story of prophecy, efforts are made to avert it and they invariably fail. This is a recursive property of prophetic myth: if the prophecy were averted, the myth would not exist and we would not know of it.

  "dn14:2.14.1": "“Renunciate” is _pabbajita_ (“one who has gone forth”), one of the many words for religious ascetics. It is a general term and does not specify his affiliation. ",
  "dn14:2.14.7": "“Celebrate” is _sādhu_, the famous Buddhist words of approval and rejoicing still heard every day in Theravāda Buddhist cultures. It later acquired the meaning “renunciate” but does not have that sense in early Pali. The virtues that he celebrates are common values of Indian religions. ",
  "dn14:2.15.3": "His apparently sudden decision to go forth arises only after an extensive period of crisis and contemplation. ",
  "dn14:2.16.6": "The idea that a whole populace would follow the bodhisatta on his renunciate path occurs several times in the Jātakas. ",

  "dn14:2.18.1": "This is the only place _vāsūpagata_ (“entered his dwelling”) is added to this stock phrase. ",
  "dn14:2.18.2": "At [sn12.14]()–10 this same reflection is attributed to each of the seven past Buddhas. This begins an investigation into dependent origination in reverse order, starting with the outcome: suffering. Here the subject is treated as a meditative contemplation. The next sutta, [dn15]() Mahānidānasutta, delves into the philosophical implications. ",
  "dn14:2.18.5": "The reflection shows how the bodhisatta is still digging into the trauma of discovering the reality of old age and death. ",
  "dn14:2.18.9": "Since there obviously cannot be an end to the “birth” that starts this life, _jāti_ in dependent origination (as often elsewhere too) means “rebirth”, the next stage in the ongoing cycle. ",
  "dn14:2.18.10": "_Yoniso maniskāra_ (“proper attention”) is a distinctively Buddhist term that literally means “attending by way of source or reason”. In early texts it is mostly used in reference to investigating causality, although over time it came to have a more general sense of “reflection, inquiry”. ",
  "dn14:2.18.11": "_Bhava_ is the ongoing process of existence, and often means simply “life” in the sense of “past and future lives”. ",
  "dn14:2.18.19": "Craving and grasping have a similar meaning, but craving is more elemental, while grasping is more sophisticated. ",
  "dn14:2.18.23": "The next three factors spell out the process of sense experience. ",
  "dn14:2.18.35": "“Name and form” (_nāmarūpa_) is a Brahmanical concept referring to the multiplicity of material appearances (_rūpa_) and associated concepts (_nāma_). The Buddha gave a more analytical spin on the term, which is explored in [dn15:20.8]() and [sn12.2:11.1](). ",
  "dn14:2.18.39": "Thus far the analysis agrees with the Upaniṣads, which say that the manifold appearances in the world arise from consciousness. ",
  "dn14:2.18.43": "Here the Buddha decisively departs from the Upaniṣadic view. Consciousness is not a fundamental property of being underlying multiplicity, but rather a conditioned phenomena that arises with multiplicity. ",
  "dn14:2.19.2": "Dependent origination normally continues with two further factors: choices and ignorance, but the sequence is sometimes concluded here, as in [sn12.65](), [sn12.67](), and [dn15](). This form emphasizes the mutuality of name and form with consciousness, but does not preclude the normal linear form. Each of the presentations of dependent origination reveals a different aspect of a complex, ramified process. ",
  "dn14:2.19.4": "Note the use of repetition to sum up the main doctrinal teachings. This serves to lock the sequence in memory and ensure no items are missing or displaced, while for one who is reciting the text from memory it provides an opportunity to reflect and apply the meaning in their own experience. ",
  "dn14:2.19.6": "This phrasing recalls the Buddha’s first sermon ([sn56.11:5.1]()), an insight that is said to be common to all Buddhas ([sn56.12:1.1]()). _Pubbe ananussutesu_ (“not learned before from another”) means that this is a new insight that was not passed down in an oral tradition. ",
  "dn14:2.21.2": "The PTS edition has _vipassanā-maggo_ here, despite admitting the term is found in no manuscripts and is taken from the commentary, where it is clearly an explanation not a reading (_maggoti vipassanāmaggo_). This egregious error of judgment is unaccountably followed by Rhys Davids and Walshe in their translations. ",

  "dn14:2.22.2": "These are the five grasping aggregates, which appeared in the Buddha’s first sermon. Most of the teachings on this topic are collected in the Khandhasaṁyutta at SN 22, but they are also found in the Dīghanikāya at [dn22:14.1](), [dn33:1.11.45](), [dn33:2.1.4](), and [dn34:1.6.16](). The contemplation on the aggregates dispels the mistaken assumption of a self. Many of the theorists in [dn1]() identify the self with one or other of the aggregates. ",
  "dn14:2.22.5": "_Saṅkhāra_ in early Buddhism has three main doctrinal senses. The broadest sense is “conditioned phenomena”, which we find in the Dīghanikāya at [dn16:6.10.10](), [dn17:2.16.1](), and [dn34:1.8.59](). This essentially means “everything except Nibbana”. Sometimes it refers to a physical or mental “process” or “activity” as at [dn18:24.1](), where it refers to the gradual stilling of energies in the development of meditation. In the five aggregates and dependent origination it has the sense of “morally potent volitions or choices” and is a synonym for _cetanā_ (“intention”). It is defined as good, bad, and imperturbable choices ([dn33:1.10.77]()), the latter of which refers to the kamma of the fourth _jhāna_ and above. In this sense it is the moral “choices” for good or ill that propel consciousness into a new rebirth. ",
  "dn14:2.22.6": "Again, the radical thesis of the Buddha’s teaching is the idea that consciousness is merely another empirical phenomena that comes to an end, as is also emphasized in the concluding verses of [dn11](). ",

  "dn14:3.1.1": "No longer a _bodhisatta_, he is now called a Buddha for the first time. ",
  "dn14:3.1.2": "In early Buddhism, the idea of teaching the Dhamma only arose after awakening. ",

  "dn14:3.2.9": "“Veiled” is _āvuṭā_, which is from the same root as _asaṁvutā_ in [dn14:1.17.5]() above. Both terms ultimately stem from the Vedic serpent Vṛtra (“the constrictor”) who wraps the world in darkness. ",
  "dn14:3.2.10": "Had he followed this inclination he would have been a _paccekabuddha_, a Buddha “awakened for himself”. ",
  "dn14:3.2.11": "In the accounts of Gotama’s life this is specified as Brahmā Sahampati. This whole passage is a moment of high cosmic solemnity and drama. ",
  "dn14:3.3.2": "The Buddha teaches on the invitation of the highest divinity. This sets a precedent that Buddhists refrain from proselytizing, but rather teach by invitation. ",
  "dn14:3.9.1": "Comm takes khema as a proper name; it is a common name for sanctuaries in the Jatakas. ",
  "dn14:3.29.18": "This is basically a table of contents for any Buddha biography. ",
