  "dn14:1.1.1": "In the suttas, _apadāna_ means “evidence”, “traces left behind” ([dn27:16.4](), [dn24:2.7.3](), [mn15:3.32](), [an3.2:1.1]()). The sense here seems to have been “(story about) the traces that deeds leave behind”. The sense “legend of past lives” probably grew out of this sutta. ",
  "dn14:1.1.2": "_Kareri_ is evidently _Miliusa tomentosa_, known as _hoom_ or _kari_ in Hindi. It is related to the custard apple, not the curry tree (_Murraya koenigii_). ",
  "dn14:1.1.4": "“Past life” is _pubbenivāsa_, literally “former abode”. ",
  "dn14:1.4.1": "At [mn71:14.2]() and [sn42.9:4.5]() the Buddha says he recollects ninety-one eons, which must refer back to the life of Vipassī. We shall see the origin of his name below. ",
  "dn14:1.4.2": "_Sikhī_ means “crested one” and refers to a halo or crown. A story of him and his disciples is told at [sn6.14:8.3](). ",
  "dn14:1.4.3": "_Vessabhū_ is Sanskrit Viśvabhṛt. It means “all-bearing”, probably originating as a word for the earth. It was the name of a legendary king, who apparently ruled over the city of Avantī ([dn19:36.14]()). ",
  "dn14:1.4.4": "Due to the appearance of four Buddhas in this cycle it is known as a “fortunate” (_bhadda_). Stories from Kakusandha’s day appear at [mn50]() and [sn15.20:2.8](). There is no obvious etymology for his name, but perhaps it stems from _kakud_ (“peak”) and thus “the union of the peaks”, a valley at the junction of mountains. ",
  "dn14:1.4.5": "The meaning of Koṇāgamana is unclear; in Sanskrit it is often spelled Kanakamuni, “the golden sage”; in the (dubious) Nigali Sagar Edict of Ashoka it is Konākamana. At [thig16.1:71.1]() we hear the past life of three nuns in the time of Koṇāgamana. ",
  "dn14:1.4.6": "Kassapa (Sanskrit Kaśyapa) means “tortoise”. It is a common Brahmanical clan name, stemming from an ancient figure reckoned as the eldest of the “seven sages”, to whom some Vedic verses are attributed. Stories of his time are found at [mn81]() and [sn48.57:3.1](). ",
  "dn14:1.4.7": "These numbers make up a quasi-logarithmic scale. In eon one there are four Buddhas. Thirty eons ago the number is halved, so they had two Buddhas. Twice-thirty eons before that, the number is halved again, to one Buddha, thus ending the scale. ",
  "dn14:1.5.7": "In ancient India, the “aristocrats” (_khattiya_) and the brahmins vied for the prestige of being the highest class. The traditional business of the aristocrats was in politics, agriculture, and war, while the brahmins were a hereditary priestly caste who served as advisers and ritualists. It is said that the Buddha-to-be was born in whatever caste was most prestigious at the time. ",
  "dn14:1.6.1": "The Koṇḍaññas (Sanskrit Kauṇḍinya) originated as the leading clan of the city of Kuṇḍina the capital of Vidarbha, which is probably modern Kaundinyapura on the Wardha River. ",
  "dn14:1.6.7": "Gotama is an ancient Brahmanical clan name, which like Kassapa stems from the Vedas and the seven sages. That it is the name of a _khattiya_ shows that there was intermarriage. ",
  "dn14:1.7.1": "",
  "dn14:1.8.1": "*Stereospermum chelonoides*. Dictionaries of Pali and Sanskrit call this the “trumpet-flower tree”, but that is more commonly used for *Oroxylum indicum*. ",
  "dn14:1.8.2": "_Puṇḍarīka_ is the white lotus. The commentary says this is _setamba_ (“white-mango”), perhaps a variety of mango with white flowers. ",

  "dn14:1.8.7": "*Ficus religiosa*, sacred to Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus alike. Ancient sources referred to it both as _assattha_ (Sanskrit _aśvattha_) and _pippala_. Buddhists today simply call it the Bodhi (or Bo) tree. ",
  "dn14:1.10.1": "The number of disciples diminishes as we approach historical time. ",
  "dn14:1.10.7": "This is perhaps the extensive journey of the Buddha with 1,250 mendicants documented in [Kd 6](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali), at one point of which occurs the events of the Selasutta ([snp3.7]() and [mn91]()). The Buddha is also accompanied by 1,250 mendicants in the Sāmaññaphalasutta ([dn2]()) and the Parosahassasutta ([sn8.8]()). ",
  "dn14:1.12.4": "The son of King Dawn and Queen Radiant at the City of the Dawn, Sikhī is the streaming rays of sunrise. These names recall a solar myth. ",
  "dn14:1.12.7": "Vessabhū’s parents King Goodfall and Queen Rainy recall a seasonal fertility myth, where they gave life to their son the earth, “the nourisher and bearer of all”. Note, however the variants _suppatīta_ (“well pleased”) and _yasavatī_ (“celebrated”). ",
  "dn14:1.12.10": "The names of the brahmin fathers all refer to ritual offerings. Aggidatta means “offered to the fire”. ",
  "dn14:1.12.11": "The names of the brahmin mothers all recall Indian _nakkhatta_. These are “constellations” or more properly “lunar mansions”; segments of the sky through which the Moon passes and which are associated with certain stars or clusters. In the Atharvaveda system, Visākhā is the 16th lunar asterism (Libra). ",
  "dn14:1.12.14": "“Offered in sacrifice”. ",
  "dn14:1.12.15": "Several constellations are distinguished as “former” (_pubba_) and “later” (_uttara_). Since it lies between Visākhā and Dhanavatī, this may be the 21st constellation, Uttara Āṣāḍhā (Sagittarius/Capricorn). ",
  "dn14:1.12.18": "“Offered to Brahmā”. Many of the Jātakas feature a king of this name, usually said to reside in Benares. ",
  "dn14:1.12.19": "Dhanavatī means “wealthy”, but it is also an alternate name for the 23rd constellation, _dhaniṣṭhā_ (or _śraviṣṭā_, Delphinus). ",
  "dn14:1.12.20": "Kikī appears in the story of the past Buddha Kassapa at [mn81](). ",

  "dn14:1.13.5": "“Principle of the teachings” is _dhammadhātu_. At [sn12.32:18.1](), Sāriputta’s mastery of the _dhammadhātu_ gives him the ability to answer any questions on the Dhamma. ",
  "dn14:1.17.1": "These characteristics of a bodhisatta’s birth are also found in [mn123](), where Ānanda quotes the Buddha, although the wording is a little different and three extra details are added at the start. In addition, this detail and that about emerging mindfully from the womb are found at [an4.127](). ",
  "dn14:1.17.2": "“Normal” is _dhammatā_, a natural principle. This entire passage differs from the earliest concept of the bodhisatta (“one intent on awakening”), which in early texts is typically applied to Siddhattha after he left the home. ",
  "dn14:1.17.5": "_Asaṁvutā_ was translated by Ñāṇamoḷī as “abysmal”, but this relies on a commentarial cosmology that is not found in the suttas. The sense, rather, is “boundless”. The root harks back to the Vedic serpent Vṛtra who wraps the world in darkness. _Nānubhonti_ (“makes no impression”) is glossed in the commentary to [an4.127]() as _nappahonti_ “ineffective”. ",
  "dn14:1.17.6": "The light is a physical one, not just a metaphor. From this, it appears that sentient beings may be spontaneously reborn in interstellar space. Compare the problem of the “Boltzmann brain” in physics. ",
  "dn14:1.17.7": "“Galaxy” is literally “the ten-thousand-fold world system”. I use the closest modern equivalent. ",
  "dn14:1.18.1": "The five precepts. ",
  "dn14:1.20.1": "While sensual pleasures provoke attachment, they are, in and of themselves, a kind of pleasure and therefore a sign of virtue and good past kamma. ",
  "dn14:1.22.1": "This tragic detail is also mentioned in [ud5.2](). The Buddha is raised by a step-mother, which in our Buddha’s case was Māyā’s sister Mahāpajāpatī. ",
  "dn14:1.23.1": "Ten signifies fullness and completion, as for example the “ten directions”. ",
  "dn14:1.24.1": "She is depicted standing while holding a tree in the pose known as _sālabhañjikā_. ",
  "dn14:1.29.1": "“Stands firm on his own feet” signifies that he will be awakened by his own efforts. “North” is _uttara_, which is also “the beyond”; this predicts his attaining Nibbana. “Seven strides” signifies crossing over the vast cycles of birth and death. The “white parasol” signifies purity and royalty. “Surveying all quarters” signifies his universal knowledge. The “dramatic proclamation” is _āsabhiṁ vācaṁ_, literally the “voice of a bull”, which is also mentioned at [sn52.9:3.2]() and [dn28:1.5]() = [sn47.12:5.2](). ",
  "dn14:1.31.1": "Many of the details of the following account were later incorporated into the life of Gotama, under the principle that the major events of the lives of Buddhas follow a natural order. Nonetheless, they do not always agree with other accounts in early texts. ",
  "dn14:1.31.3": "In [snp3.11](), the newborn Siddhattha is examined by the dark hermit Asita, who was not identified as a brahmin. These two versions are combined in later accounts. ",
  "dn14:1.31.7": "Asita did not look at the 32 marks, and he predicted only one destiny: that he would become a Buddha. ",
  "dn14:1.32.7": "This echoes the posture of the newborn bodhisatta, and has the same meaning: that he will become awakened by “standing on his own two feet”. ",
  "dn14:1.32.8": "These are often depicted in Buddhist art. It signifies the perfection and completeness of the traces that the Buddha leaves behind in his teachings and practice. ",
  "dn14:1.32.9": "Many of the signs do not have any obvious symbolic meaning, but [dn30]() explains all of them with a Dhammic significance. ",
  "dn14:1.32.13": "If this is the correct interpretation of _ussaṅkha_, it is hard to reconcile with the detail that his footprints clearly show the thousand-spoked wheel. ",
  "dn14:1.32.15": "This appears to contradict the statement below that the span of his hands equals the height of his body, which is the normal human proportion. ",
  "dn14:1.32.24": "His back is muscular. ",
  "dn14:1.32.27": "It is hard to see how this is detected by others. ",
  "dn14:1.32.35": "At [thig13.1:6.2]() Ambapālī describes her eyes as _abhinīla_. While some Indians do indeed have blue eyes, this probably describes a black so deep it appears blue. ",
  "dn14:1.32.38": "The _uṇhīsa_ is depicted as a bulge on the Buddha’s head, signifying his higher knowledge. Originally it probably just meant that his head was a regular oval shape. ",
  "dn14:1.33.9": "This is the _dakkhiṇā_, the religious offering given in gratitude and respect for the services. ",
  "dn14:1.34.1": "His birth mother has passed away and there is no mention of a step-mother. ",
  "dn14:1.36.1": "Normally clairvoyance and related abilities are said to arise due to the power of the fourth _jhāna_, whereas here it comes naturally due to past kamma. The difference is that after _jhāna_ the mind is entirely clear of hindrances. Here it seems to be a more limited ability to see clearly and in the dark. ",
  "dn14:1.37.2": "Vipassī’s name is simply the personal form of the word made famous in Buddhist meditation, _vipassanā_. This is usually rendered as “insight”, but the sense here is more like “clear seeing”. ",
  "dn14:1.37.4": "",
  "dn14:1.37.5": "Indian epistemology acknowledges two fundamental sources of knowledge: direct perception (_paccakkha_) and inference (_anumāna_). This passage shows that _vipassanā_ includes both. ",
  "dn14:2.2.12": "“Brood” is _pajjhāyati_. He is having an existential crisis. ",
  "dn14:2.4.2": "In any story of prophecy, efforts are made to avert it and they invariably fail. This is a recursive property of prophetic myth: if the prophecy were averted, the myth would not exist and we would not know of it. But because the myth does exist, we know how it ends and the prophecy must come true. ",
  "dn14:2.5.1": "An existential crisis takes its own time; it cannot be rushed. ",
  "dn14:2.6.7": "",
  "dn14:2.10.1": "Neither reading _vilāta_ or _milāta_ appears to occur elsewhere in this sense. The commentary says it is a bier (_sivika_). ",
  "dn14:2.14.1": "“Renunciate” is _pabbajita_ (“one who has gone forth”), one of the many words for religious ascetics. It is a general term and does not specify his affiliation. ",
  "dn14:2.14.7": "“Celebrate” is _sādhu_, the famous Buddhist words of approval and rejoicing still heard every day in Theravāda Buddhist cultures. It later acquired the meaning “renunciate” but does not have that sense in early Pali. The virtues that he celebrates are common values of Indian religions. ",
  "dn14:2.15.3": "His apparently sudden decision to go forth arises only after an extensive period of crisis and contemplation. ",
  "dn14:2.16.6": "The idea that a whole populace would follow the bodhisatta on his renunciate path occurs several times in the Jātakas. ",
  "dn14:2.16.7": "Following PTS edition in omitting _janapada_, which is absent from the commentary and the parallel passage at [dn19:58.3](). ",
  "dn14:2.18.1": "This is the only place _vāsūpagata_ (“entered his dwelling”) is added to this stock phrase. ",
  "dn14:2.18.2": "At [sn12.14]()–10 this same reflection is attributed to each of the seven past Buddhas. This begins an investigation into dependent origination in reverse order, starting with the outcome: suffering. ",
  "dn14:2.18.5": "The reflection shows how the bodhisatta is still digging into the trauma of discovering the reality of old age and death. ",
  "dn14:2.18.9": "Since there obviously cannot be an end to the “birth” that starts this life, _jāti_ in dependent origination (as often elsewhere too) means “rebirth”, the next stage in the ongoing cycle. ",
  "dn14:2.18.11": "_Bhava_ is the ongoing process of existence, and often means simply “life” in the sense of “past and future lives”. ",
  "dn14:2.21.2": "The PTS’s inclusion of vipassana here, unaccountably followed by RD and MW, is an egregious and embarassing error. No manuscript contains this reading, and the PTS edition itself states that the word is found only in the commentary. To be clear, there it is obviously presented not as a reading but as an explanation: “Maggoti vipassanāmaggo.” ",
  "dn14:3.9.1": "Comm takes khema as a proper name; it is a common name for sanctuaries in the Jatakas. ",
  "dn14:3.29.18": "This is basically a table of contents for any Buddha biography. ",
  "dn14:3.29.20": "While this is absent here, they are all mentioned below, and comm says they should be included here. This must be just a clumsy abbreviation. ",
  "dn14:3.30.1": "In PTS, unlike MS, the deities who came to see the Buddha are numbered as “hundreds”, which seems more reasonable. RD has this, while MW does not. "
