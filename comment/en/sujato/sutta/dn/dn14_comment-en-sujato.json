  "dn14:1.1.1": "In the suttas _apadāna_ is used consistently in the sense of “evidence”, “traces left behind” ([dn27:16.4](), [dn24:2.7.3](), [mn15:3.32](), [an3.2:1.1]()). The sense here seems to have been “(story about) the traces that deeds leave behind”. The sense “legend of past lives” probably grew out of this sutta. ",
  "dn14:1.1.2": "_Kareri_ is evidently _Miliusa tomentosa_, known as _hoom_ or _kari_ in Hindi. It is related to the custard apple, not the curry tree (_Murraya koenigii_). ",
  "dn14:1.1.4": "“Past life” is _pubbenivāsa_, literally “former abode”. ",
  "dn14:1.4.1": "At [mn71:14.2]() and [sn42.9:4.5]() the Buddha says he recollects ninety-one eons, which must refer back to the life of Vipassī. ",
  "dn14:1.4.4": "Due to the appearance of four Buddhas in this cycle it is known as a “fortunate” (_bhadda_). ",
  "dn14:1.5.7": "In ancient India, the ‘aristocrats” (_khattiya_) and the brahmins vied for the prestige of being the highest class. The traditional business of the aristocrats was in politics, agriculture, and war, while the brahmins were a hereditary priestly caste who served as advisers and ritualists. ",
  "dn14:1.7.1": "Both RD and MW say this is the lifespan in that eon. And it is true that this is the normal usage of ayuppamana. However, in such cases the subject in genitive is given as plural, to denote the entire generation, etc. Here it is singular, and specifies only Vipassi. Sure, it’s likely that this would have been typical, but I don’t think that’s what the text is saying. Note that when the Buddha speaks of his own life, he uses a different phrasing. If ayuppamana here referred to the lifespan of the current generation, there would be no reason for the Buddha to not apply it to himself. But if it means that of the individual, then it makes sense why he would shift to a more indirect statement. ",
  "dn14:1.8.2": "puṇḍarīka is the white lotus; Comm says this is setamba, which must have been a tree with lotus-like flowers, I guess. ",
  "dn14:1.8.7": "peepul seems to be the most common of the many words for the Bodhi tree. ",
  "dn14:1.10.1": "Both RD and MW have “assemblies”, which is a little misleading. It doesn’t refer to permanent groupings, but events. ",
  "dn14:1.12.22": "",
  "dn14:1.37.4": "MW is wrong here. ",
  "dn14:2.6.7": "Both RD and MW misconstrue this idiom. It is commonly used in the sense of “shortly, in no long time”, i.e. “hopefully” something will happen. ",
  "dn14:2.10.1": "Neither reading vilāta or milāta appears to occur elsewhere in this sense. Comm says “Vilātanti sivikaṁ”; Tika says: “Bhantanettakuppalādi vividhaṁ katvā lātabbato vilāto, vayhaṁ, sivikā cāti āha ‘‘vilātanti sivika’’nti. Sivikāya diṭṭhapubbattā mahāsatto citakapañjaraṁ ‘‘sivika’’nti āha”. ",
  "dn14:2.16.7": "Following PTS in omitting janapada, which seems out of place here, and is absent from the parallel passage in DN 19. ",
  "dn14:2.21.2": "The PTS’s inclusion of vipassana here, unaccountably followed by RD and MW, is an egregious and embarassing error. No manuscript contains this reading, and the PTS edition itself states that the word is found only in the commentary. To be clear, there it is obviously presented not as a reading but as an explanation: “Maggoti vipassanāmaggo.” ",
  "dn14:3.9.1": "Comm takes khema as a proper name; it is a common name for sanctuaries in the Jatakas. ",
  "dn14:3.29.18": "This is basically a table of contents for any Buddha biography. ",
  "dn14:3.29.20": "While this is absent here, they are all mentioned below, and comm says they should be included here. This must be just a clumsy abbreviation. ",
  "dn14:3.30.1": "In PTS, unlike MS, the deities who came to see the Buddha are numbered as “hundreds”, which seems more reasonable. RD has this, while MW does not. "
