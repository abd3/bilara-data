  "dn33:1.1.2": "This discourse picks up from [dn29:17.1](), where the Buddha urges that the Sangha should gather and recite the Dhamma for the long lasting of the dispensation. There he lists the 37 factors of awakening, a standard early collation of practice-oriented teachings that are primarily collected in the Mahāvagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. This discourse is a late one, and appears to be an initial attempt to compile a more thorough list of the Buddha’s teachings. The Sarvāstivāda version of the same discourse formed the basis of one of their seven Abhidhamma books, the Sangītiparyāya. ",
  "dn33:1.1.3": "At [an10.176}() Cunda asks about the purity of the western brahmins; at [dn16:4.13.5\n]() = [ud8.5]() he offers the Buddha’s last meal; at [snp1.5]() he asks about a true ascetic. ",
  "dn33:1.2.1": "This hall is not mentioned anywhere else. At [sn35.243:1.2]() and [mn53:2.1]() Sakyans invite the Buddha to first use a new town hall. Such halls were community meeting places that played a central role in civic society and politics in democratic republics such as the Mallas and the Sakyans. ",

  "dn33:1.5.5": "The Buddha likewise mentions his bad back and invites another monk to teach in both the other suttas where he is first to teach in a new hall ([mn53:5.3](), [sn35.243:3.4]()), and also on the _uposatha_ at Naḷakapāna ([an10.67](), [an10.68]()). These were all occasions when the community was sitting late into the night. ",
  "dn33:1.6.1": "As at [dn29:1.3]() and [mn104:2.1](), in both of which the Buddha was in the Sakyan lands at this time. There, the news is conveyed to the Buddha by the novice Cunda. Perhaps he was confused with Cunda the smith. ",
  "dn33:1.7.10": "Sāriputta adopts the “Aṅguttara principle” of arranging teachings by number rather than the “Saṁyutta principle” of arrangement by topic. Thus this list of teachings has more in common with the Aṅguttara Nikāya, compared with the Buddha’s original list of Saṁyutta topics. I note unusual or rare terms. ",
