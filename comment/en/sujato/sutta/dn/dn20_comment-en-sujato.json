  "dn20:3.4": "“Great congregation” is _mahāsamaya_. ",
  "dn20:3.15": "A village ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:3.8]]()) or royal compound ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.56.1]()) was marked with a “boundary post” (_indakhīla_). It symbolized a fixed and immovable point, either in a good sense ([sn56.39:4.1]()) or, as here, an obstacle. For Mahāsaṅgīti’s _ūhacca manejā_ read _ūhacca-m-anejā_. ",
  "dn20:3.17": "_Nāga_ can refer to a class of semi-divine beings in a powerful serpentine form (“dragon”); a large and powerful snake, especially a king cobra; a bull elephant; or any powerful and mighty being (“giant”). ",

  "dn20:4.3": "This recalls [dn14:1.10.1](), where the relative sizes of the mendicant congregations of different Buddhas are tallied. That sutta, in another point of similarity, also featured a conversation with deities of the Pure Abodes. ",
  "dn20:5.1": "“Paean of praise” is _siloka_, a rare case where this means “verse (of praise)” rather than “fame, renown”. _Anukassāmi_ is present tense from the root _kass_, “to draw (up), to drag”. Compare Sanskrit _anukarṣa_ in the sense “invoking, summoning by incantation”. ",
