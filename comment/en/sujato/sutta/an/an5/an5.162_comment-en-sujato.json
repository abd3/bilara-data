  "an5.162:6.4": "Bodhi has “leader of the village district”, which seems unlikely in the context. _gāmantanāyaka_ is not glossed and doesn’t appear elsewhere. The Chinese text doesn’t, so far as I can tell, have anything closely corresponding to this phrase. Notice also that here, _gāmanta_ must mean “village”, not “outskirts of a village”, and here as in dn10:2.11.2 it is associated with safety, i.e. inside the protection of the village."
