  "an5.142:1.3": "Note the unusual use of _ārabhati_ here.",
  "an5.142:6.4": "Bodhi omits translating _āyasmā_ in this passage, which is all that makes it clear it’s talking about mendicants. Also his note quotes without remark from the Commentary, explaining _citta_ as _vipassanacitta_. However, the text is structured on _sīla_, _samādhi_, _paññā_, with _citta_ as a synonym for _samādhi_. Here the commentary confuses a clear meaning by applying its own special doctrine to the text."
