  "an4.51:1.2": "Abhisanda is a curiously obscure term, only found in this context. BB has “stream”, which doesn’t seem to quite hit the mark. When used in Skt it doesn’t mean a stream generally, but an “overflow”, typically used for conjunctivitis. Kalidasa uses it twice (Raghuvamsa 15.29, Kumarasambhava 6.37) in the sense of a population that has been multiplied by the overflow from heaven (https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/giirvaani/giirvaani/rv/sargas/15_rv.htm) The point is that when you offer something, you get merit, and when the mendicant uses it well, your merit multiplies. A derived passage is found in Mahavastu, 2.276: yo yaṁ mama deyadharmaparityāgāt puṇyābhisyandaḥ kuśalābhisyandaḥ sukhasyādhāraṇaṁ me divyaṁ upabhogaṁ bhaveyā… Notice that this reads “bearers of happiness” rather than “food for happiness.” ",
  "an4.51:5.1": "Note that AN parallels for this passage use ganetum instead of gahetum. I retain the difference, since it seems to be systematic. "
