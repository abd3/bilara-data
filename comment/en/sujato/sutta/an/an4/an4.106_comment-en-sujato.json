  "an4.106:1.1": "The summary verse at the end of  the chapter (AN 4.110) mentions “two on mangoes”. The commentary notes the existence of a discourse here, but merely says that its meaning is clear. A note in the VRI edition says that there is a reading that has _obhāsa_ where the previous sutta has _vaṇṇa_. "
