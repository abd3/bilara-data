  "an4.180:3.9": "The Pali text appears to say that one should remember the _mahāpadesa_, whereas the Sanskrit clearly says one should remember the teaching (_ayaṁ dharmo’yaṁ vinaya idaṁ śāstuḥ śāsanam iti viditvā dhārayitavyāḥ_). It seems as if this pattern should underlie the Pali too, for one has already “memorized” (_uggahita_) the teaching, and if it is false, one “should reject it” (_ chaḍḍeyyātha_). Surely if it is correct there should be a parallel injunction that one “should remember it” (_dhāreyyātha_). But if _dhāreti_ applies to the _mahāpadesa_ there is no such injunction. Thus it seems as if the Sanskrit is correct here and the Pali corrupt. I restore it by reversing the order of the phrases. "
