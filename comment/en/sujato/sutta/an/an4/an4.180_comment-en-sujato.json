  "an4.180:1.6": "“Great references” is _mahāpadesa_; also at [dn16.4.7.3](). A different set of four _mahāpadesas_ are [pli-tv-kd6:40.1.1](), which provide criteria so that mendicants may judge what is and is not allowable. ",
  "an4.180:2.3": "The standard phrase used in the suttas when reporting a teaching heard directly from the Buddha, eg. [sn55.52:5.1](), [sn22.90:9.1](), [mn47:10.7](), etc. ",
  "an4.180:3.9": "The Pali text appears to say that one should remember the _mahāpadesa_, whereas the Sanskrit clearly says one should remember the passage (_ayaṁ dharmo’yaṁ vinaya idaṁ śāstuḥ śāsanam iti viditvā dhārayitavyāḥ_). It seems as if this pattern should underlie the Pali too, for the passage is false, one “should reject it” (_chaḍḍeyyātha_). If the passage is correct we should expect a parallel injunction that one “should remember it” (_dhāreyyātha_). But if this applies to the _mahāpadesa_ there is no such injunction. Thus it seems as if the Sanskrit is correct here and the Pali corrupt. I restore it by reversing the order of the phrases. "
