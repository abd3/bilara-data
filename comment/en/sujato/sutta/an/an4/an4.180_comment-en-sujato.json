  "an4.180:3.9": "The Pali text appears to say that one should remember the _mahāpadesa_, whereas the Sanskrit clearly says one should remember the passage (_ayaṁ dharmo’yaṁ vinaya idaṁ śāstuḥ śāsanam iti viditvā dhārayitavyāḥ_). It seems as if this pattern should underlie the Pali too, for the passage is false, one “should reject it” (_chaḍḍeyyātha_). If the passage is correct we should expect a parallel injunction that one “should remember it” (_dhāreyyātha_). But if this applies to the _mahāpadesa_ there is no such injunction. Thus it seems as if the Sanskrit is correct here and the Pali corrupt. I restore it by reversing the order of the phrases. "
