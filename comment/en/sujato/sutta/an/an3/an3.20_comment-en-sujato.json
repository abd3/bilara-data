  "an3.20:2.1": "_Vidhura_ only occurs here, and as an epithet of the Buddha at snp5.1:21.3. The Sanskrit meanings of _vidhura_ are mostly negative and it doesn’t seem to be the same word (√vidh). The only real guide we have to meaning is here, where it stands for the energy of the shopkeeper or later the mendicant. Apparently it is the same sense as _anikkhittadhuro_, glossed by the commentary as _visiṭṭhadhuro uttamadhuro ñāṇasampayuttena vīriyena samannāgato_. The commentary at snp5.1:21.3 gives the opposite sense there (_vigatadhuro, appaṭimo_), but there seems no reason not to read it the same way in both places. ",
  "an3.20:3.3": "BB usually translates _puttadāra_ as “wife and children”. However when the compound is resolved, _dāra_ is usually in plural, “wives”. I render with the gender-neutral “partner” except where the context is gendered. Also note that notions of marriage have always been more flexible in English than in Christian lands, and arrangements that we might consider defacto partnerships might also be known by the same terms.
