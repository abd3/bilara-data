  "an6.26:1.7": "The “opportunity amid confinement” (_sambādhe okāsādhigamo_) is also found in [an9.37]() and [an9.42](), while three “opportunities” are found in [dn18:23.4](). In each case the teachings are different. Also note that the three Aṅguttara sutta that use this term all have settings that omit to mention the Buddha, which is usually a sign that they occur after the Parinibbāna. [dn18](), while set shortly before the Parinibbāna, is obviously late. "
