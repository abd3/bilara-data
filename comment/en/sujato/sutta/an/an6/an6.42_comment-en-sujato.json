  "an6.42:5.1": "Contra BB’s “outskirts of a village”, _gāmanta_ must mean “within a village”. It is regularly contrasted with _arañña_, and never with plain old _gāma_. Sometimes _vananta_ is contrasted, where the suffix has the same force, “within a forest”. I use “village district” for _gāmakkhetta_, strictly “a village together with its fields”, and “neighborhood of a village” for _gāmasāmanta_.",
  "an6.42:5.3": "See BB’s note on the vll. The Chinese (SA 1250) doesn’t seem to clarify. Note that Comm says “Samādhimhā cāvessatīti samādhito uṭṭhāpessati”. Perhaps uṭṭhāpessati has been back-read into some texts, and corrupted to ghaṭessati."
