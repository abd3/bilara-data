  "an6.61:2.1": "In the Pārāyana, this begins with the demonstrative pronoun _so_ that calls back to the previous verse, which here is not quoted. The relative pronoun _yo_ subtly changes the sense, as it links this couplet with the next, while in the original they are simply two distinct statements. I translate each context accordingly, on the assumption that this is an ancient variation, rather than making them agree."
