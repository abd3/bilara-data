  "an7.7:2.4": "BB’s “units of minted gold” is a terribly artificial idiom for a common term. Despite occurring frequently, there is little in the suttas to distinguish hiranna from suvanna. However Mnd 1 says hiraññaṁ vuccati kahāpaṇoti. On the whole, suvanna seems to be used widely for natural gold and golden things, hiranna is less common and is most characteristically used, as here, when reckoning wealth, eg Cīvaracetāpannaṁ nāma hiraññaṁ vā suvaṇṇaṁ vā muttā vā maṇi vā; Natthi me, āvuso, hiraññassa paṭivīso, nāhaṁ hiraññaṁ sādiyāmī; Khettaṁ vatthuṁ hiraññaṁ vā, gavāssaṁ dāsaporisaṁ; Asīti sakaṭavāhānaṁ, hiraññassa ahosi me; Pahūtaṁ me jātarūpaṁ, muttā veḷuriyā; Vaṇijjā tādisī natthi, hiraññena kayākayaṁ; Na pasū brāhmaṇānāsuṁ, na hiraññaṁ na dhāniyaṁ. However, also consider the Hirannavati River, i.e. river with gold (nuggets or dust). ",
  "an7.7:4.3": "BB says these verses are identical with AN 7.5, however these two lines are different."
