  "snp5.12:1.4": "While the exact sense of the unique term _sahajanetta_ is open to interpretation, surely Norman’s “omniscient one” (following Niddesa) is not right.",
  "snp5.12:2.1": "The following line lacks a verb, and Norman, Bodhi, and Ñāṇadīpa all construe it with _abhibuyya_: the sun “overcomes” the earth. But that doesn’t make sense. Rather, the idiom _abhibhuyya iriyati_ leans on _irayati_ in the sense “to keep going, to proceed”. The Buddha “proceeds” (i.e. keeps living) after mastering desires, like the sun “proceeds” shedding light on the earth. "
