  "snp3.11:1.2": "Bodhi and Norman follow the PTS reading _sakkacca_ here, but it seems uncharacteristic to me. Why mention they have just honored Indra? On the other hand, it’s common to express “a group with its leader”.",
  "snp3.11:9.3": "Here, as so often, “autumn” (per Bodhi and Norman) conveys quite the wrong impression. Autumn is the time of gathering clouds, _sarada_ is the time after the rains.",
  "snp3.11:11.2": "Here the commentary glosses _paṇḍu_ as _ratta_ (“red”), followed both Norman (“pale red”) and Bodhi. But _paṇḍu_ means “pale, white, cream, yellowish” and I can’t see anywhere in Pali or Sanskrit to suggest a meaning “red”. Given that it’s the standard color of a luxurious rug, perhaps it is due to a change in fashions; in the Buddha’s day luxury was cream-colored, but later it became red."
