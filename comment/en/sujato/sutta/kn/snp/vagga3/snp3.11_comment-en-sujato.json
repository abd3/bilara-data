  "snp3.11:1.2": "Bodhi and Norman follow the PTS reading _sakkacca_ here, but it seems uncharacteristic to me. Why mention they have just honored Indra? On the other hand, it’s common to express “a group with its leader”.",
  "snp3.11:7.2": "Notice the use of the humble _bhavana_ rather than the royal _pasāda_. This, and the lack of any royal titles, suggests that, while this passage moves towards the pomp of later legend, it does not regard the Buddha’s family as royal. Hence I translate _kumāra_ throughout as “boy”.",
  "snp3.11:9.3": "Here, as so often, “autumn” (per Bodhi and Norman) conveys quite the wrong impression. Autumn is the time of gathering clouds, _sarada_ is the time after the rains.",
  "snp3.11:11.2": "Here the commentary glosses _paṇḍu_ as _ratta_ (“red”), followed both Norman (“pale red”) and Bodhi. But _paṇḍu_ means “pale, white, cream, yellowish” and I can’t see anywhere in Pali or Sanskrit to suggest a meaning “red”. Given that it’s the standard color of a luxurious rug, perhaps it is due to a change in fashions; in the Buddha’s day luxury was cream-colored, but later it became red.",
  "snp3.11:16.3": "Neither Bodhi’s “fortitude” nor Norman’s “peerless one” quite capture the force of _asamadhura_. The implication is that, as the forger of the path, the Buddha carries a burden greater than any other.",
  "snp3.11:18.1": "Note the idiom _parato ghosaṁ_ here.",
  "snp3.11:18.2": "This is a succinct definition of _buddha_, not an alternate thing that you might hear people say, per Bodhi and Norman.",
  "snp3.11:18.3": "Both Norman and Bodhi have “doctrine” here, while commentary is silent. I’m not aware of _samaya_ in the sense of “doctrine” in the early texts, nor is it listed in the senses of _samaya_ in the commentarial analysis in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī commentary, Kāmāvacarakusala. Given that the concern in previous lines is the notion of an awakened one, surely we have here an abbreviated _abhisamaya_ i.e. “breakthrough, enlightenment experience”.",
  "snp3.11:19.2": "I find it curious that this epithet is used of both the Buddha and Asita.",
  "snp3.11:19.4": "Possibly the only usage of “hope” in a spiritual sense in the EBTs.",
  "snp3.11:22.4": "Bodhi accepts the commentarial gloss of _pada_ as _paṭipadā_ here, but I find his reasoning unconvincing. Yes, the text speaks of practice, but this correlates to the first part of the answer. Here, at the end of the question, it relates to the end of the text, which speaks of the state of sagacity.",
  "snp3.11:28.2": "As other instances of this line make clear, the referent of _yattha_ is _kāmā_, i.e. the pleasures of the senses, not the desire and greed of the previous line. Bodhi gets this nuance right, Norman does not."
