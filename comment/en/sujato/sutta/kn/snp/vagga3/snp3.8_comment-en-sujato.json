  "snp3.8:1.1": "I can’t find any translation or note that captures this line properly. A _nimitta_ is a sign or portent, and is commonly used in the context of omens, prophecy, or fortune-telling. Here it means that there is no portent or omen by which one can predict the extent of life.",
  "snp3.8:3.2": "Accepting _niccaṁ_ per Norman and Bodhi.",
  "snp3.8:15.1": "segment",
  "snp3.8:17.4": "Commentary says this means, “I cannot bring back the dead” followed by Norman, Bodhi, and Thanissaro. But I think that reading is suspect on two grounds. First, it requires reading in quite a bit, as evidenced by the [square brackets] in translations of Norman and Bodhi; Thanissaro on the other hand  evidently thinks _labbhā_ means “fetch”, whereas it means “possible”. The second suspicion is doctrinal: it simply isn’t the kind of thing the Buddha encouraged people to say in such cases. Rather, the normal reflection is, “How could it possibly be otherwise” (_Taṁ kutettha labbhā_) or “I too am of the same nature”. I think the text elides a second negative and should read: _na eso alabbhā_, lit. “It is not that this is not-to-be-gained by me”."
