  "snp3.10:16.4": "I can’t find any explanation for the shift to direct address in second person here. Perhaps these verses were inserted from a separate source.",

  "snp3.10:20.1": "Commentary says the hell-keepers are the subject here, hell-dwellers the subject of the next line. But this seems forced and unnecessary. Those going to hell are screaming, not uttering sweet words.",
  "snp3.10:20.4": "Read _aggini-samaṁ jalitaṁ_, as at 22.2 below. "
