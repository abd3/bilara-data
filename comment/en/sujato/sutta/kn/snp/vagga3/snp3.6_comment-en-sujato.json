For the sake of consistency with later uses of the term, it might seem prudent to use “mental activity” here, and most translators have done so. Yet the context in this verse suggests it is about the aeons of transmigration.",

  "snp3.6:27.1": "_Paṇḍarāni_ means not “senses” per commentary (followed without remark by Norman); nor “tranlucencies” per Bodhi, nor “white flowers” per Thanissaro. In the EBTs, _paṇḍara_ simply means “white, pure” and is a synonym for _suddhi_ in the next line. A true _paṇḍita_ is pure both inside and out."
