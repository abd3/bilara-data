  "snp3.6:16.1": "Comm allows _kappa_ in the sense of both “mental activity” and “aeon” here. For the sake of consistency with later uses of the term, it might seem prudent to use “mental activity” here, and most translators have done so. Yet the context in this verse suggests it is about the aeons of transmigration.",
  "snp3.6:16.2": "",
  "snp3.6:24.1": "I think Norman’s reconstruction of this to root _ñā_ (followed by Bodhi) is too speculative, the word makes fine sense as is, and is more metaphorically connected with the sense of _khetta_.",
  "snp3.6:25.1": "Reading _vijeyya_; both _viceyya_ and _vijeyya_ are accepted in the commentary.",
  "snp3.6:27.1": "The commentary has led translators astray here. _Paṇḍarāni_ means not “senses” per commentary (followed without remark by Norman); nor “translucencies” per Bodhi; nor “white flowers” per Thanissaro. In the EBTs, _paṇḍara_ simply means “white, pure” and is a synonym for _suddhi_ in the next line. A true _paṇḍita_ is pure both inside and out.",
  "snp3.6:33.2": "Commentarial “abode of energy” for _viriyavāso_ doesn’t sound right to me, though followed by Bodhi and Norman. I read _viriyavā so_.",
  "snp3.6:33.4": "Reading _vīro_.",
  "snp3.6:37.1": "Earlier translations misconstrued this verse and missed the point. The gerunds _sutvā_ and _abhiññāya_ apply to their respective following accusatives _sabbadhammaṁ_ and _sāvajjānavajjaṁ_, not both to _sabbadhammaṁ_ per Norman and Bodhi. _Dhamma_ obviously means “teachings” here, not _phenomena_ per Bodhi. The sense is that to be a “scholar” it is not enough to have “learned” the teachings, one must know for oneself. Thanissaro attempts to get this sense, but can only do so by adding in an extra and unsupported reading of _abhiññāya_ as dative."
