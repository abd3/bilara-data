  "snp4.9:1.4": "_Icche_ is 1st optative. _Naṁ_ may be feminine (“her”) but here it connects with _idaṁ_ in the previous line, so it must be neuter (“it”). ",
  "snp4.9:3.1": "The sense only emerges with the specific nuance of terms. _Niccheyya_ means to “judge, decide” not simply “consider”; and _samuggahītaṁ_ means “[a view that is] adopted” (not “assumed” or “grasped”). Finally, the _na_ here applies, not just to _idaṁ vadāmi_, but also to _samuggahītaṁ_, with which _idaṁ_ agrees.",
  "snp4.9:5.1": "_Suti_ is what is “heard”, but with the extra emphasis on “heard via oral transmission of a sacred scripture”. Reading the “instrumental of relation”  in this context."
