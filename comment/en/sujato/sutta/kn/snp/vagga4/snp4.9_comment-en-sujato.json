  "snp4.9:1.4": "_Icche_ is 1st optative. _Naṁ_ may be feminine (“her”) but here it connects with _idaṁ_ in the previous line, so it must be neuter (“it”). ",
  "snp4.9:3.1": "The sense only emerges with the specific nuance of terms. _Niccheyya_ means to “judge, decide” not simply “consider”; and _samuggahītaṁ_ means “[a view that is] adopted” (not “assumed” or “grasped”). Finally, the _na_ here applies, not just to _idaṁ vadāmi_, but also to _samuggahītaṁ_, with which _idaṁ_ agrees.",
  "snp4.9:5.1": "_Suti_ is what is “heard”, but with the extra emphasis on “heard via oral transmission of a sacred scripture”. I think the case should be read here as “instrumental of relation”, since the question was not, “how is peace attained”, but “how is it described”.",
  "snp4.9:5.3": "_Pi_ here doesn’t qualify _sīlabbata_ (per Norman), it co-ordinates with _nopi tena_. I capture this with the neither/nor construction.",
  "snp4.9:12.4": "_Anupanīto_ (“not led in”) relates to _neyyo_ (“needing to be led”) in the previous line. _Anupanīto_ has the sense of “one who has been educated (in recitation)” at mn93:15.2. Compare English “brought into the fold”. The sense of “dogma” for _nivesana_ is established at snp4.3:6.3 and snp4.5:6.3."
