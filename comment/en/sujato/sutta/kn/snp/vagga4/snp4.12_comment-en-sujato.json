  "snp4.12:1.3": "Here, as often in the Aṭṭhakavagga, _jānāti_ implies different ways of knowing, which may be right or wrong (to degrees).

  "snp4.12:3.2": "Preferring _omako_ over _mago_, which seems a little harsh; _omako_ conforms to the principle of least meaning.",
  "snp4.12:5.1": "I think “this is correct” refers, not to the assertion of a view, but to the assertion that the other is a fool.",
  "snp4.12:5.2": "Here I take _bālā_ as the quoted speech, as in the lines above and below. The commentary supplies the expected quotation indicator: _‘bālo’ti āhu_. If we take _bālā_ as subject of the verb here, per Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa, then the Buddha is adopting the reductive language of those he seeks to counter, obscuring the sense of the verse.",
  "snp4.12:5.3": "I think it’s important to maintain the past sense of _akaṁsu_ here: a view is something they have constructed and built up over time; it has solidified and become part of them, which is why it’s so hard to give up."
