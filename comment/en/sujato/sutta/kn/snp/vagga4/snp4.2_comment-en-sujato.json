  "snp4.2:2.2": "_Te duppamuñca_ has been taken by most translators as referring to people, in senses either active (Bodhi’s “let go with difficulty”) or passive (Norman’s “are hard to release”). However the phrase occurs in a very similar context at sn3.10:5.2 and dhp346:2, where it refers to the chains that are hard to escape.",
  "snp4.2:7.1": "The reference here is to the two ends of contact (an6.61) rather than the two extremes of views or paths.",
  "snp4.2:8.1": "Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all, apparently following the commentary, take _vitareyya_ as an optative here. But the previous verse was talking about an arahant, and here the one who has fully understood perception has already crossed over. In the same phrase at snp3.5:13.2 _vitareyya_ is clearly an absolutive, and is rendered as such there by both Bodhi and Norman."
