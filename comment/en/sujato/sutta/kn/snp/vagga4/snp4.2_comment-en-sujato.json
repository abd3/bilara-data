  "snp4.2:2.2": "_Te duppamuñca_ has been taken by most translators as referring to people, in senses either active (Bodhi’s “let go with difficulty”) or passive (Norman’s “are hard to release”). However the phrase occurs in a very similar context at sn3.10:5.2 and dhp346:2, where it refers to the chains that are hard to escape."
