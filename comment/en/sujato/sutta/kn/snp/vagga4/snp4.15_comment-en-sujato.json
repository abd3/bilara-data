  "snp4.15:3.4": "_Osita_ and _osāna_ in the next line have two main senses, to “end” (cf. _pariyosāna_), or to “reside”. The fact that they follow right after the mention of finding  “home” in the “world” in an unafflicted “quarter” surely shows that the sense “reside” applies. Nonetheless, both Norman and Bodhi translate the two occurrences as “unoccupied” and “at the end”, obscuring the fact that they are literally the same word in different form; while Ñāṇadīpa has “obstruct”. In this case the Niddesa’s explanation should surely be taken as a moralizing extension of the text. "
