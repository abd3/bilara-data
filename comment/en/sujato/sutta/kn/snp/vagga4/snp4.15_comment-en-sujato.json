  "snp4.15:3.4": "_Osita_ (and _osāna_ in the next line) convey both “occupy” and “end”, in the sense of a place of rest at the end of a journey.",
  "snp4.15:4.1": "Here, _tveva_ has an adversative sense, “but even then …”. This verse contrasts with the previous, a contrast lost in the translations by Norman, Bodhi, Ñāṇadīpa, Thanissaro, Olendzki, Ireland, Mills, and Hare. Nor is the sense “settlement” for _osāna_ found in DoP, CPD, or PTS Dictionary. So far as I know, the only source with the correct reading of these terms is the Digital Pāli Dictionary. ",
  "snp4.15:6.1": "Agreeing with Norman that this line is likely a reciter’s remark. However I take _tattha_ as the locative of reference, else it would be _ettha_. The practical guidelines that follow show how to extract the dart."
