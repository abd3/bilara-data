  "snp4.15:3.4": "_Osita_ (and _osāna_ in the next line) has the root sense “lay to rest”; originally it probably meant the place that one laid down one’s burdens at the end of the day (cf. _khema_). From there we see two main applications, to “end” (cf. _pariyosāna_), or to “reside”. The fact that they follow right after the mention of finding “home” in the “world” in an unafflicted “quarter” surely shows that the sense “reside” applies. Nonetheless, both Norman and Bodhi translate the two occurrences as “unoccupied” and “at the end”, obscuring the fact that they are literally the same word in different form. Meanwhile Ñāṇadīpa has “obstruct”. In this case the Niddesa’s explanation should surely be taken as a moralizing extension of the text.",
  "snp4.15:4.1": "Here, _tveva_ has an adversative sense, “but even then …”. This verse contrasts with the previous, a contrast lost in the translations by Norman, Bodhi, Ñāṇadīpa, Thanissaro, Olendzki, Ireland, and Hare."
