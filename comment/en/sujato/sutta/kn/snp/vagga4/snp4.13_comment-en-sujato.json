  "snp4.13:2.4": "If we render _khema_ as “security” and _bhūmi_ as “stage” then we miss the metaphor. _Abhi-√pas_ is found at an3.39:11.4 and an5.57:15.4 where it has a similar sense of “looking forward to”.",
  "snp4.13:6.4": "The Niddesa’s explanation of _santi_ as “view” is not plausible. I follow Norman.",
  "snp4.13:7.1": "Reading _tapūpanissāya_; see Bodhi’s note 1961. Since in prose _tapojigucchā_usually occur together, I treat them as such here. ",
  "snp4.13:7.3": "This refers to the doctrine of _saṁsārasuddhi_, that the process of rebirth leads to release. See mn102:11.3. _Anutthunati_ rather consistently means “bemoans”, and here I think it is used in a disparaging way of those who, suffering under self-inflicted mortification, moan that purity is just around the corner.",
  "snp4.13:12.1": "Here I follow Ñāṇadīpa, who takes the whole verse as a conditional argument, whereas Bodhi and Norman treat each couplet separately. I think the verse is making the argument that each ascetic bases their teaching on their own experience, and so if their teachings were equally valid, then purity would be attained by many (mutually exclusive) means."
