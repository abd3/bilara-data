  "snp4.3:1.1": "_Duṭṭhamana_, or more commonly _paduṭṭhamana_, means “malice” not “corruption”, as is found through the Suttas, and confirmed by the Niddesa.",
  "snp4.3:2.2": "Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all render _chanda_ as “desire”, and that is certainly the sense of _chandānunīto_ at sn35.94:6.4. Here, however, Niddesa glosses with synonyms for “view” and this seems like a more plausible sense."
