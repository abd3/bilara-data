  "snp4.4:1.1": "The _aroga_ refers to the _attā_. Better to make it explicit in the text.",
  "snp4.4:1.3": "Here as in 4.3, _ñāṇa_ is used in the sense of “notion”. Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all follow Niddesa in taking _abhijāna_ in its usual sense of “understanding, direct knowing”. But here the secondary sense of “recall” fits better. Someone thinking about their theory of purity postulates that there must be an observer of such purity."
