  "snp4.4:1.1": "This line refers to seeing a supposed saint or holy person, a sight that was believed to grant blessings. Note that, as Bodhi remarks, _aroga_ refers to the _attā_; however this does not necessarily mean an immaterial soul. Here what is seen is the soul as a physical form (_rūpī attā_) manifesting purity and wellness.",
  "snp4.4:1.3": "Here as in 4.3, _ñāṇa_ is used in the sense of “notion”. Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all follow Niddesa in taking _abhijāna_ in its usual sense of “understanding, direct knowing”. But here the secondary sense of “recall” fits better. Someone thinking about their vision of what they think is purity believs that there must be an observer of such purity.",
  "snp4.4:1.4": "_Pacceti_ is a standard verb for someone who “believes” in a religious rite or idea."
