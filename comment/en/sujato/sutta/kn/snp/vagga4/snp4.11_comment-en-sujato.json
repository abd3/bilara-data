  "snp4.11:3.4": "_Samparāya_ means “in the next life”. The Niddesa’s gloss of “refuge, shelter” etc. is not meant to change this but to qualify it: people look for safety in the next life.",

These are not “normal” as they have no sense-perception or defilements; they are not “distorted”, they are not the non-percipient realm; and they do not perceive the “form” that has disappeared, namely the _oḷarikarūpa_ that has disappeared in _rūpajjhāna_,  which however retains the _sukhumarūpa_ of pure radiance.",
  "snp4.11:13.4": "In mn18, we have the sequence perception, thought, proliferation, then _papañcasaññāsaṅkhā_. This suggests that _papañca_ causes _saṅkhā_, as per Bodhi.",
  "snp4.11:15.1": "Such as the Buddha’s former teachers, who aimed at rebirth in formless realms."
