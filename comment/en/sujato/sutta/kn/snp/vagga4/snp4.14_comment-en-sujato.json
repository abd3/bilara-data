  "snp4.14:4.3": "Reading _puṭṭho_ per variants, and contra most translators and the Niddesa. I find the renderings by Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa to be borderline incomprehensible. Norman and Ñāṇadīpa are surely incorrect in taking _rūpa_ here as “forms”, but that is a tempting direction once we read _phuṭṭho_. The passage up till now has been about conceit that arises from knowledge. I think the sense here is the same as an9.14:11.11: _Sādhu kho tvaṁ, samiddhi, puṭṭho puṭṭho vissajjesi, tena ca mā maññī_ (“It’s good that you answered each question. But don’t get conceited because of that.” )"
