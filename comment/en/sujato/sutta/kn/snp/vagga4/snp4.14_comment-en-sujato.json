  "snp4.14:2.3": "_Mantā_ is explained by Niddesa (followed by Bodhi) as “wisdom” and treated as a truncated instrumental. It is elsewhere found as an agent noun in a positive sense, and is thus rendered by Ñāṇadīpa as “deep thinker”. These renderings are certainly possible, but the context, as the next verses make clear, deal with someone who suffers conceit due to their learning and understanding. A _mantā_ is one to whom others turn for advice or wise counsel. Furthermore, _asmīti_ commonly follows nominatives in a similar sense, eg. _seyyohamasmīti_. Thus I take _mantā asmīti_ as a single phrase.",
  "snp4.14:4.3": "Reading _puṭṭho_ per variants, and contra most translators and the Niddesa. I find the renderings by Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa to be borderline incomprehensible. Norman and Ñāṇadīpa are surely incorrect in taking _rūpa_ here as “forms”, but that is a tempting direction once we read _phuṭṭho_. The passage up till now has been about conceit that arises from knowledge. I think the sense here is the same as an9.14:11.11: _Sādhu kho tvaṁ, samiddhi, puṭṭho puṭṭho vissajjesi, tena ca mā maññī_ (“It’s good that you answered each question. But don’t get conceited because of that.” )",
  "snp4.14:6.2": "This must have been a folk belief at the time. Not long after the Buddha, India began to engage in long-distance oceanic trade with Rome and then China, and the sailors would have been swiftly disabused of this notion. This is, then, a sign of earliness."
