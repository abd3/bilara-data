  "snp4.14:6.1": "The commentary explains _majjhe_ “in the middle” firstly as between top and bottom layers, or alternatively as in-between the mountains (i.e. land masses). While it’s possible that there was a folk belief that the center of the ocean was waveless, surely a striking feature of the ocean is how the surface movement conceals a stillness beneath. ",

  "snp4.14:13.3": "PTS Dictionary suggests this should be read as the better-established _viruddhagabbhakaraṇaṁ_ ([dn1:1.26.2]()). If it is an error in the reading, it predates the Niddesa. Nonetheless, I translate _gabbhakaraṇa_ in a way that encompasses causing both pregnancy and abortion. ",
