  "snp1.1:2.3": "Here the “near shore and the far” must mean “this life and the next”.",
  "snp1.1:7.1": "The commentary interprets _vitakka_ as “wrong thoughts”, but the identical line at [ud6.7:4.1]() clearly refers to _jhāna_. The commentary also reads _vidhūpitā_ as “burning up”, but _vidhūpa_ refers to clearing the mist, smoke, or incense. ",
  "snp1.1:9.2": "Bodhi, Norman, and Ṭhānissaro all render _vitatha_ as “unreal”. Normally it’s used in the context of “true” speech or the “reality” or “unerringness” of say dependent origination. To say the whole world is “unreal” seems overly idealistic for early Buddhism, so I translate in accord with the apparent sense."
