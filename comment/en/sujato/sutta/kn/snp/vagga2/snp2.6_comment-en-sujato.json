  "snp2.6:1.1": "The titles Kapilasutta and Dhammacariyasutta are both found in manuscripts and commentary. In the Mahāsaṅgīti edition, Kapilasutta is attested in the summary verse of the Sutta Nipāta as a whole ([snp5.19:22.2]()), while Dhammacariyasutta is attested in the summary verse for this chapter ([snp2.14:31.3]()). The BJT has Kapilasutta throughout. Given that _kapila_ does not occur in the sutta itself, while _dhammacariya_ occurs in the first line, most likely _kapila_ made its way into the title by contamination from the commentary. "
