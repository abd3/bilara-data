  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.8": "[Sp.2.589](): _Sīsūpagantiādīsu sīsaṃ upagacchatīti sīsūpagaṃ, potthakesu pana ‘‘sīsūpaka’’nti likhitaṃ, yassa kassaci sīsālaṅkārassetaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Esa nayo sabbattha_, “In regard to ʻWhat is meant for the headʼ, etc., ʻWhat is meant for the headʼ means what goes to the head. In the books, however, it is written ʻ_sīsūpaka_ʼ. This is a term for whatever is an ornament for the head.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.63.1": "The commentarial explanation makes it clear that what is meant here is that one exchanges money for money. The same is true for the next two cases. See Sp.1.589: _purimasikkhāpade vuttavatthūsu nissaggiyavatthunā nissaggiyavatthuṁ cetāpentassa_, “For one who is exchanging an object to be relinquished with another object to be relinquished, in accordance with the cases spoken of in the previous training rule.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.66": "The explanation at Sp.1.589 makes it clear that what is meant here is that one exchanges what is not money into money, that is, one is selling something and therefore ending up with money: _Attano vā hi arūpiyena parassa rūpiyaṁ cetāpeyya_, “One exchanges one’s own non-money for someone else’s money.” The same is true for the next two cases.
