  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:1.39": "The phrase _ubhova santā ekena_, here translated as “put together”, is not immediately clear. It seems to me that this phrase needs to be related to the main sentence verb _acchādetha_, “present” or “give”, which takes the instrumental of the thing given: “present (him) with one (robe)”. _Ubhova santā_ is explained below in the word commentary as _dvepi janā_, “both people”, and the overall phrase then becomes, “two people present (him) with one (robe)”. This means that the funds are put together, and I translate accordingly. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:2.8": "_Agāraṁ_ is typically rendered as \"in a house\". The problem with this is that it is not unallowable for a monastic to live in a building that is the equivalent of a house. What a monastic should not do is own a home and then live there. "
