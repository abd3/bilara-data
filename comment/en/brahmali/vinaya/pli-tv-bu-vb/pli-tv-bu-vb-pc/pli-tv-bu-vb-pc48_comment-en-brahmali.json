  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc48:1.22.1": "_Uyyuttaṁ senaṁ_ refers to an “active/mobilized army”. In contrast to present-day professional military personnel, at the time of the Buddha soldiers would be called up directly from their villages. From this point of view, present-day militaries are permanently mobilized. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc48:2.13.1": "“Army” renders _uyyutta sena_, which might be rendered “a mobilized army”. At the time of the Buddha it seems armies consisted entirely of reserve troops that would then be mobilized at times of war. With the advent of professional armies, however, armies are always more or less mobilized. Thus my rendering. "
