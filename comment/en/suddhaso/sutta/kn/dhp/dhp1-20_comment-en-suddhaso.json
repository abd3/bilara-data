  "dhp1:1": "\"Mano\" here is clearly being used in its ordinary meaning - \"mind.\" While it may be tempting to translate it as something else (such as \"intention\"), this would be tantamount to rewriting the text. Similarly, \"dhammā\" here has its broadest meaning - that is, all phenomena. Translating it simply as \"mindstates\" or \"experiences\" vastly limits the otherwise sweeping implications of the Buddha's statement.",
  "dhp1:2": "This line clearly establishes the concept that ultimately everything is mind - a concept which later become a critical lynchpin in the development of Mahāyāna philosophy.",
  "dhp1:6": "\"Cakkaṁ\" (wheel) \"va\" (as) \"vahato\" (follows) \"padaṁ\" (track/path/foot/phrase). This phrase offers a wide range of possible interpretations, due to the ambiguity of the grammar and the multiple possible meanings of the word \"pada.\" This rendering is a translation of the passage which does not add any words not found in the original text.",
  "dhp2:4": "\"Pasanna\" has the meanings \"clear, joyful, faithful.\"",
  "dhp6:2": "\"Yamāmase\" is from the verb \"yamati\" which means \"to be restrained.\" The commentary's explanation of this line appears to imply that it means \"to die\"; however, the literal meaning of the passage does not have any such connotation.",
  "dhp7:3": "",
  "dhp10:2": "This could also be translated as something like \"one who has good samādhi during all activities.\"",
  "dhp11:4": "\"Micchā-saṅkappa\" - that is, the opposite of \"sammā-saṅkappa\" from the Noble Eightfold Path.",
  "dhp15:1": "\"Pecca\" usually carries the particular meaning of \"after death\" (ie, in future lives)."
