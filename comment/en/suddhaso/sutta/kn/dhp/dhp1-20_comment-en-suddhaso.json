  "dhp1:1": "\"Mano\" here is clearly being used in its ordinary meaning - \"mind.\" While it may be tempting to translate it as something else (such as \"intention\"), this would be tantamount to rewriting the text. Similarly, \"dhammā\" here has its broadest meaning - that is, all phenomena. Translating it simply as \"mindstates\" or \"experiences\" vastly limits the otherwise sweeping implications of the Buddha's statement.",
  "dhp1:2": "This line clearly establishes the concept that ultimately everything is mind - a concept which later become a critical lynchpin in the development of Mahāyāna philosophy. In an attempt to escape this inescapable fact, some translators have chosen to entirely rewrite this passage.",
  "dhp1:6": "\"Cakkaṁ\" (wheel) \"va\" (as) \"vahato\" (follows) \"padaṁ\" (track/path/foot/verse/poem). This phrase offers a wide range of possible interpretations, due to the ambiguity of the grammar and the multiple possible meanings of the word \"pada.\" This rendering is a translation of the passage which does not add any words not found in the original text.",
  "dhp2:4": "\"Pasanna\" has the meanings \"clear, joyful, faithful.\""
