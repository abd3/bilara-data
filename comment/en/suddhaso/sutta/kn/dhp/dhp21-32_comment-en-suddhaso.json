  "dhp21:0.3": "_Appamāda_ is the negation of _pamāda_ (negligence, carelessness, recklessness). While _appamāda_ is often translated as “vigilance” or “heedfulness”, it is good to remember that the literal meaning is simply “non-negligence”. ",
  "dhp21:1": "The term _amatapadaṁ_ is grammatically ambiguous. Since in the the following phrase _maccuno_ is in the Genitive/Dative case, it is presumable that _amata-_ is as well. ",
  "dhp30:2": "_Maghavā_ was one of the names of Sakka (aka Inda/Indra), the lord of the Tāvatimsa heaven. ",
  "dhp31:2": "_Bhaya_ can mean either “danger” or “fear”. The meaning of “danger” seems more likely here, since fear is a negative mindstate produced by defilements. ",
  "dhp32:3": "This statement equates to stream-entry (_sotāpanna_)."
