  "dhp21:0.3": "_Appamāda_ is the negation of _pamāda_ (negligence, carelessness, recklessness). While _appamāda_ is often translated as “vigilance” or “heedfulness”, it is good to remember that the literal meaning is simply “non-negligence”.",
  "dhp21:1": "The term _amatapadaṁ_ is grammatically ambiguous. As in the the following phrase _maccuno_ is in the Genitive/Dative case, it is presumable that _amata-_ is as well."
