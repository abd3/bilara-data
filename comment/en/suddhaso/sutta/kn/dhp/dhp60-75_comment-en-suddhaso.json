  "dhp60:2": "The term _yojana_ is a unit of distance. Its exact length is uncertain; estimates vary widely, mostly within the range of 8km to 15km.",
  "dhp61:4": "_Sahāyatā_ is from _saha_ (together) + _aya_ (go) + _tā_ (-ness). Therefore _sahāyatā_ literally means “the aspect of going together”. Although usually translatable as “companionship”, in this context a more literal translation seems appropriate. A very literal rendering might be “There is no going-together with a fool” or “there is no togetherness with a fool”."
