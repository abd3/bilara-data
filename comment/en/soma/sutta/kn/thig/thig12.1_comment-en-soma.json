  "thig12.1:1.1": "'sīte' appears to be locative - perhaps locative of time. So I think it is referring to when the weather is cold, not the water that she is collecting. So perhaps this could be translated \"I used to fetch water in the cold\" or something similar. That said, considering the context of the rest of this sutta, it appears to me that 'udahārī' does not mean 'water-carrier' or 'one who fetches water', but rather someone who is devoted to the religious practice of bathing in cold water. The literal meaning of 'udahārī' is 'water-taker', but that may be similar to how we say things like \"Now I will take a shower\". So perhaps this line means \"I am one who bathes in cold water...\"",

  "thig12.1:3.4": "You left out 'kata' (\"done\") - the bad deeds that have been done. I might translate this line as \"By making good karma, one obstructs the bad karma that was previously made.\" [Perhaps rewrite it to be a little more concise]",
