For example, \"uttering intricate and foolish speech\"; or taking 'sucittaṁ' to be an adjective referring to her body (ie, the body is intricately/beatifully embellished, and she also utters foolish speech, or speech for fools - 'bālalapanaṁ' can mean \"foolish speech\", \"speech for fools\", \"speech by fools\", etc.",
