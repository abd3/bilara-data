  "thig13.1:1.1": "Interesting. When I hear 'the color of bees' I immediately think of yellow as their primary color, and black as secondary. Anyway, besides the point, as your translation appears accurate.",
  "thig13.1:1.2": "hmm, I think 'sprang' would be correct here, instead of 'sprung.' (english is so weird.)",
  "thig13.1:1.3": "Below you translated 'Jarāya' as \"because of old age\" - I think that is better. I recommend standardizing it as such throughout this sutta. \"because of old age it is now like hemp-bark\"",
  "thig13.1:1.4": "'anaññathā' means 'not otherwise' - ie, 'unvarying, unchanging, not wrong, reliable, accurate.' Perhaps this could be translated \"the truth-speaker's words are never wrong.\"",
  "thig13.1:2.1": "\"Like scents from a fragrant casket,\" (though note that the word 'casket' usually refers to a funeral casket - ie, the box for burying dead bodies - so that is what most people will think of. I would recommend using a more generic word.)",
  "thig13.1:2.2": "\"full of flowers\" may be referring to the 'casket' in the previous phrase. Perhaps the sentence means \"A fragrance like a box full of flowers // sprang from this head of mine\".",
  "thig13.1:2.3": "\"because of old age now it just smells like hair.\" (\"sa+loma+gandhika\" = \"with+hair+smell\")",

  "thig13.1:3.3": "\"because of old age, it is now thinning here and there\" or \"...thinning in places\"",

  "thig13.1:4.3": "\"because of old age my head has gone bald\"",
  "thig13.1:5.1": "no need for the word 'before'",
  "thig13.1:5.2": "\"so beautiful, as if drawn by a painter,\"",
  "thig13.1:5.3": "'vali' is 'fold/wrinkle' - since there is only one word in Pāli is it really necessary to say two  words in English? perhaps something like \"because of old age they hang down in folds\"",

  "thig13.1:6.2": "'as radiant and splendid as gemstones'"
