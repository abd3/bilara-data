  "thig13.1:1.1": "Interesting. When I hear 'the color of bees' I immediately think of yellow as their primary color, and black as secondary. Anyway, besides the point, as your translation appears accurate.",
  "thig13.1:1.2": "hmm, I think 'sprang' would be correct here, instead of 'sprung.' (english is so weird.)",
  "thig13.1:1.3": "Below you translated 'Jar캐ya' as \"because of old age\" - I think that is better. I recommend standardizing it as such throughout this sutta. \"because of old age it is now like hemp-bark\"",
  "thig13.1:1.4": "'ana침침ath캐' means 'not otherwise' - ie, 'unvarying, unchanging, not wrong, reliable, accurate.' Perhaps this could be translated \"the truth-speaker's words are never wrong.\"",
  "thig13.1:2.1": "\"Like scents from a fragrant casket,\" (though note that the word 'casket' usually refers to a funeral casket - ie, the box for burying dead bodies - so that is what most people will think of. I would recommend using a more generic word.)",
  "thig13.1:2.2": "\"full of flowers\" may be referring to the 'casket' in the previous phrase. Perhaps the sentence means \"A fragrance like a box full of flowers // sprang from this head of mine\"."
