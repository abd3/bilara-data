  "thig15.1:43.3": "The term Mahilā only appears twice In the Pāli Canon. It has been translated as 'woman', from the similar Sanskrit word that has this meaning.  \n\nNeither female or male = unclear genitals. But genitals the Vasettha Sutta tells us it doesn’t distinguish people. There are no superior or inferior genitals. \nOne theory could be not a human being\n\nBut I suspect it’s from ‘maha,’ worthiness, with the suffix -lā to convey perhaps female and male, or “mahita” honored….. which would make sense due to the status of slave.\n"
