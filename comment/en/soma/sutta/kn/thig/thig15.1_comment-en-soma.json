  "thig15.1:43.3": "The term Mahilā only appears twice In the Pāli Canon. It has been translated as 'woman', from the similar Sanskrit word that has this meaning.   \n\nI translate the mahilā as honored, by taking this word ‘maha,’ worthiness, with the suffix -lā to convey perhaps female and male, or “mahita” honored….. which would make sense due to the status of slave.\n"
