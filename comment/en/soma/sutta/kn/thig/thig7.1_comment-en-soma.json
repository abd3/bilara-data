  "thig7.1:3.3": "Bonus points for recognizing the \"paṭi-/pacc-\" prefix as \"re-\" (as in, 're-consider' instead of just 'consider'). Points then lost for translating 'saṅkhārā' as 'volitional formations' - I recommend just using 'formations', or if you want more, 'conditional formations.' It is dangerous to assume that 'saṅkhāra' is being used in a narrow sense when there is nothing in the text to indicate it is not being used in its broadest sense."
